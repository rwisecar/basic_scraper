            <h2>Craig Kerstiens: Simple but handy Postgres features</h2>
        </a>

        <p class="discreet">
            
            
                  From Planet PostgreSQL.
            
            
                Published on <span name="publication_time">Jan 08, 2017</span>.
            
        </p>

        <p>It seems each week when I&rsquo;m reviewing data with someone a feature comes up that they had no idea existed within Postgres. In an effort to continue documenting many of the features and functionality that are useful, here&rsquo;s a list of just a few that you may find handy the next time you&rsquo;re working with your data.</p>

<h3>Psql, and \e</h3>

<p>This one I&rsquo;ve <a href="http://www.craigkerstiens.com/2013/02/13/How-I-Work-With-Postgres/">covered before</a>, but it&rsquo;s worth restating. Psql is a great editor that already comes with Postgres. If you&rsquo;re comfortable on the CLI you should consider giving it a try. You can even setup you&rsquo;re own <code>.psqlrc</code> for it so that it&rsquo;s well customized to your liking. In particular turning <code>\timing</code> on is especially useful. But even with all sorts of customization if you&rsquo;re not aware that you can use your preferred editor by using <code>\e</code> then you&rsquo;re missing out. This will allow you to open up the last run query, edit it, save–and then it&rsquo;ll run for you. Vim, Emacs, even Sublime text works just take your pick by setting your <code>$EDITOR</code> variable.</p>

<h3>Watch</h3>

<p>Ever sit at a terminal running a query over and over to see if something on your system changed? If you&rsquo;re debugging something whether locally or even live in production, watching data change can be key to figuring out. Instead of re-running your query you could simply use the <code>\watch</code> command in Postgres, this will re-run your query automatically every few seconds.</p>

<p>```sql
SELECT now() &ndash;</p>

<pre><code>   query_start, 
   state, query 
</code></pre>

<p>FROM pg_stat_activity
\watch
```</p>

<h3>JSONB pretty print</h3>

<p>I love <a href="https://www.citusdata.com/blog/2016/07/14/choosing-nosql-hstore-json-jsonb/">JSONB</a> as a datatype. Yes, in cases it won&rsquo;t be the <a href="http://blog.heapanalytics.com/when-to-avoid-jsonb-in-a-postgresql-schema/">optimal</a> for performance (though at times it can be perfectly fine). If I&rsquo;m hitting some API that returns a ton of data, I&rsquo;m usually not using all of it right away. But, you never know when you&rsquo;ll want to use the rest of it. I use Clearbit this way today, and for safety sake I save all the JSON result instead of de-normalizing it. Unfortunately, when you query this in Postgres you get one giant compressed text of JSON. Yes, you could pipe out to something like jq, or you could simply use Postgres built in function to make it legible:</p>

<p>```sql
SELECT jsonb_pretty(clearbit_response)
FROM lookup_data;</p>

<pre><code>                            jsonb_pretty
</code></pre>

<hr />

<p> {</p>

<pre><code> "person": { 
     "id": "063f6192-935b-4f31-af6b-b24f63287a60", 
     "bio": null, 
     "geo": { 
         "lat": 37.7749295, 
         "lng": -122.4194155,                                              
         "city": "San Francisco", 
         "state": "California", 
         "country": "United States", 
         "stateCode": "CA", 
         "countryCode": "US" 
     }, 
     "name": { 
     ...
</code></pre>

<p>```</p>

<h3>Importing my data into Google</h3>

<p>This one isn&rsquo;t Postgres specific, but I use it on a weekly basis and it&rsquo;s key for us at Citus. If you use something like Heroku Postgres, dataclips is an extremely handy feature that lets you have a real-time view of a query and the results of it, including an anonymous URL you can it for it. At Citus much like we did at Heroku Postgres we have a dashboard in google sheets which pulls in this data in real-time. To do this simple select a cell then put in: <code>=importdata("pathtoyourdataclip.csv")</code>. Google will import any data using this as long as it&rsquo;s in CSV form. It&rsquo;s a great lightweight way to build out a dashboard for your business without rolling your own complicated dashboarding or building out a complex ETL pipeline.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m sure I&rsquo;m missing a ton of the smaller features that you use on a daily basis. Let me know <a href="https://www.twitter.com/craigkerstiens">@craigkerstiens</a> the ones I forgot that you feel should be listed.</p>

<strong>Where</strong>: iovation<br />
<strong>Who</strong>: Mark Wong<br />
<strong>What</strong>: pglogical</p>
<p>Mark Wong will give an overview of pglogical, the latest replication option for Postgres. It&#8217;s a lower-impact option than trigger-based replication, and features include the ability to replicate only the databases and tables you choose from a cluster. Part of the talk will cover use cases and future development plans.</p>

USA.</p>
<p>&#8212;<br />
If you have a job posting or event you would like me to announce at the meeting, please send it along. The deadline for inclusion is 5pm the day before the meeting.<br />
&#8212;</p>
<p>Our meeting will be held at iovation, on the 32nd floor of the US Bancorp Tower at 111 SW 5th (5th &amp; Oak). It&#8217;s right on the Green &amp; Yellow Max lines. Underground bike parking is available in the parking garage; outdoors all around the block in the usual spots. No bikes in the office, sorry!</p>
<p>iovation provides us a light dinner (usually sandwiches or pizza).</p>
<p>Elevators open at 5:45 and building security closes access to the floor at 6:30.</p>

            <h2>How to Implement Custom Authentication with Django REST Framework</h2>
        </a>

        <p class="discreet">
            
                  By Chris Bartos from Django community aggregator: Community blog posts.
            
            
            
                Published on <span name="publication_time">Jan 06, 2017</span>.
            
        </p>

        <h2>Introduction to Custom Authentication</h2>
<p>Custom Authentication in Django REST Framework is the way you would create any time of authentication you would want. In fact, inside of the internals of DRF, you will find every other authentication scheme that I’ve talked about using CustomAuthentication. So, let’s look at an example of how you would implement something like this.</p>
<h2>How to Implement Custom Authentication</h2>
<p><strong>WARNING</strong>: The example I’m about to show you is VERY VERY bad for security so DON’T use it in production. <img alt="🙂" class="wp-smiley" src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/2.2.1/72x72/1f642.png" style="height: 1em;" /></p>
<p>First, you will need to override the <code>BaseAuthentication</code> class. It looks like this:</p>
<p><em>my_proj/accounts/auth.py</em> from django.contrib.auth.models import User from rest_framework.authentication import BaseAuthentication from rest_framework import exceptions</p>
<pre><code>class MyCustomAuthentication(BaseAuthentication):
    def authenticate(self, request):
        username = request.GET.get("username")

        if not username: # no username passed in request headers
            return None # authentication did not succeed

        try:
            user = User.objects.get(username=username) # get the user
        except User.DoesNotExist:
            raise exceptions.AuthenticationFailed('No such user') # raise exception if user does not exist

        return (user, None) # authentication successful
</code></pre>
<p>I called the new class <code>MyCustomAuthentication</code>. If you look at what this does, it retrieves a <code>username</code> as a <code>GET</code> request and will try to find a user with that <code>username</code>. (You should now understand why this is a stupid example).</p>
<p>Next, in <code>settings.py</code> you’ll want to update the <code>DEFAULT_AUTHENICATION</code> setting.</p>
<p><em>settings.py</em> REST_FRAMEWORK = { &#8216;DEFAULT_AUTHENTICATION_CLASSES&#8217;: ( &#8216;accounts.auth.MyCustomAuthentication&#8217;, ), &#8216;DEFAULT_PERMISSION_CLASSES&#8217;: ( &#8216;rest_framework.permissions.IsAuthenticated&#8217;, ) }</p>
<p>And that is LITERALLY all you need to do to create a new authentication scheme. Download the custom code below and try going to the following URL:</p>
<p><a href="http://localhost:8000/polls/api/questions/1/?username=chris">http://localhost:8000/polls/api/questions/1/?username=chris</a></p>
<p>You should be able to see the data. Also, if you go to:</p>
<p><a href="http://localhost:8000/polls/api/questions/1/">http://localhost:8000/polls/api/questions/1/</a></p>
<p>The authentication scheme should deny you from getting any data at all.</p>

<h2>Homework</h2>

<li>Run the sample code and go to the two URLs above.</li>
<li>Try to implement your own Session Authentication scheme WITHOUT enforcing CSRF tokens using Custom Authentication. <a href="https://github.com/tomchristie/django-rest-framework/blob/master/rest_framework/authentication.py#L110">You can see how Session Authentication is implemented here</a></li>

        <p>During normal server shutdown, sessions are disconnected, dirty
<a class="txt2html" href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.6/static/runtime-config-resource.html#RUNTIME-CONFIG-RESOURCE-MEMORY" style="text-decoration: none;"><em>shared buffers</em></a> and pending
<a class="txt2html" href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.6/static/wal-intro.html" style="text-decoration: none;">write-ahead log</a> (WAL) records are flushed to durable storage, and
a clean shutdown record is written to <a class="txt2html" href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.6/static/wal-internals.html" style="text-decoration: none;"><em>pg_control</em></a>.  During the next
server start, <em>pg_control</em> is checked, and if the previous shutdown was clean, startup can ignore the WAL and start immediately.
</p>
<p>Unfortunately, a clean shutdown can take some time, and impatient database administrators might get into the habit of using <em>kill -9</em> or
<em>pg_ctl -m immediate</em> to quicken the shutdown.  While this does have the intended effect, and you will not lose any committed
transactions, it greatly slows down the next database startup because all WAL generated since the last completed checkpoint must
be replayed.  You can identify an unclean shutdown by looking at the server logs for these two ominous lines:
</p>
<p><blockquote>
</p><pre class="quote_explicit">
LOG:  database system was interrupted; last known up at 2016-10-25 12:17:28 EDT

        <p>Using a managed service is a very attractive proposition. You are offloading a heck of a lot of worry, especially when it comes to something as complicated and, let&#8217;s face it, specialized as a database. Someone else will set it up for you, and back it up, and keep it running, without you having to worry overmuch about it. However, there are downsides. You can only get what the manager is offering. Often that&#8217;s good enough. But needs change, and I have often seen people start with managed services, only to find that they want more than they can get that way.</p>
<p>Just yesterday I received a complaint that the Redis Foreign Data Wrapper, which I have done a lot of work on, is not available on Amazon RDS. And that&#8217;s completely understandable. Amazon only provide a limited number of extensions, and this isn&#8217;t one of them. At least one other managed service, Heroku, does offer this extension, but there are others it doesn&#8217;t offer.</p>
<p>So the lesson is: choose your managed service, or even whether to use a managed service at all, very carefully, taking into account both your current needs and your likely future needs.</p>

        <p>Today’s post, the first one of 2017, is about the following feature of the
upcoming Postgres 10:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>commit: 3901fd70cc7ccacef1b0549a6835bb7d8dcaae43
author: Fujii Masao &lt;fujii@postgresql.org&gt;
date: Mon, 19 Dec 2016 21:15:30 +0900
Support quorum-based synchronous replication.

This feature is also known as "quorum commit" especially in discussion
on pgsql-hackers.

This commit adds the following new syntaxes into synchronous_standby_names
GUC. By using FIRST and ANY keywords, users can specify the method to
choose synchronous standbys from the listed servers.

FIRST num_sync (standby_name [, ...])
ANY num_sync (standby_name [, ...])

The keyword FIRST specifies a priority-based synchronous replication
which was available also in 9.6 or before. This method makes transaction
commits wait until their WAL records are replicated to num_sync
synchronous standbys chosen based on their priorities.

The keyword ANY specifies a quorum-based synchronous replication
and makes transaction commits wait until their WAL records are
replicated to *at least* num_sync listed standbys. In this method,
the values of sync_state.pg_stat_replication for the listed standbys
are reported as "quorum". The priority is still assigned to each standby,
but not used in this method.

The existing syntaxes having neither FIRST nor ANY keyword are still
supported. They are the same as new syntax with FIRST keyword, i.e.,
a priority-based synchronous replication.

</div>

<p>9.6 has introduced the possibility to specify multiple synchronous standbys
by extending the syntax of
<a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/devel/static/runtime-config-replication.html#runtime-config-replication-master">synchronous_standby_names</a>.
For example values like ‘N (standby_1,standby_2, … ,standby_M)’ allow
a primary server to wait for commit confirmations from N standbys among the
set of M nodes defined in the list given by user, depending on the availability
of the standbys at the moment of the transaction commit, and their reported
WAL positions for write, apply or flush. In this case, though, the standbys
from which a confirmation needs to be waited for are chosen depending on their
order in the list of the parameter.</p>

<p>Being able to define quorum sets of synchronous standbys provides more
flexibility in some availability scenarios. In short, it is possible to
validate a commit after receiving a confirmation from N standbys, those
standbys being <em>any</em> node listed in the M nodes of synchronous_standby_names.
So this facility is actually useful for example in the case of deployments
where there is a primary with two or more standbys to bring more flexibility
in the way synchronous standbys are chosen. Be careful though that it is
better to have a low latency between each node, but there is nothing new
here…</p>

<p>In order to support this new feature, and as mentioned in the commit message,
the grammar of synchronous_standby_names has been extended with a set of
keywords.</p>

<ul>
  <li>ANY maps to the quorum behavior, meaning that any node in the set can be
  used to confirm a commit.</li>
  <li>FIRST maps to the 9.6 behavior, giving priority to the nodes listed
  first (higher priority number defined).</li>
</ul>

<p>Those can be used as follows:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code># Quorum set of two nodes
any 2(node_1,node_2)
# Priority set of two nodes, with three standbys
first 1(node_1,node_2,node_3)
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>Note as well that not using any keyword means ‘first’ for
backward-compatibility. And that those keywords are case insensitive.</p>

<p>One last thing to know is that pg_stat_replication marks the standbys
in a quorum set with… ‘quorum’. For example let’s take a primary with
two standbys node_1 and node_2.</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>=# ALTER SYSTEM SET synchronous_standby_names = 'ANY 2(node_1,node_2)';
ALTER SYSTEM
=# SELECT pg_reload_conf();
 pg_reload_conf
----------------
 t
(1 row)
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>And here is how they show up to the user:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>=# SELECT application_name, sync_priority, sync_state FROM pg_stat_replication;
 application_name | sync_priority | sync_state
------------------+---------------+------------
 node_1           |             1 | quorum
 node_2           |             2 | quorum
(2 rows)
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>Note that the priority number does not have much meaning for a quorum set,
though it is useful to see them if user is willing to switch from ‘ANY’
to ‘FIRST’ to understand what would be the standbys that would be considered
as synchronous after the switch (this is still subject to discussions on
community side, and may change by the release of Postgres 10).</p>

            <h2>Event sourcing in Django</h2>
        </a>

        <p class="discreet">
            
                  By Yoong Kang Lim from Django community aggregator: Community blog posts.
            
            
            
                Published on <span name="publication_time">Jan 05, 2017</span>.
            
        </p>

        <p>Django comes with "batteries included" to make CRUD (create, read, update, delete) operations easy. It's nice that the CR part (create and read) of CRUD is so easy, but have you ever paused to think about the UD part (update and delete)?</p>
<p>Let's look at delete. All you need to do is this:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="n">ReallyImportantModel</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">objects</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">get</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nb">id</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="mi">32</span><span class="p">)</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">delete</span><span class="p">()</span>  <span class="c1"># gone from the database forever</span>
</pre></div>


<p>Just one line, and your data is gone forever. It can be done accidentally. Or you can be do it deliberately, only to later realise that your old data is valuable too.</p>
<p>Now what about updating? </p>
<p><em>Updating is deleting in disguise</em>. </p>
<p>When you update, you're deleting the old data and replacing it with something new. <em>It's still deletion</em>.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="n">important</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">ReallyImportantModel</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">object</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">get</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nb">id</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="mi">32</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="n">important</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">update</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">data</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="p">{</span><span class="s1">'new_data'</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="s1">'This is new data'</span><span class="p">})</span>  <span class="c1"># OLD DATA GONE FOREVER</span>
</pre></div>


<p>Okay, but why do we care?</p>
<p>Let's say we want to know the state of <code>ReallyImportantModel</code> 6 months ago. Oh that's right, you've deleted it, so you can't get it back. </p>
<p>Well, that's not exactly true -- you can recreate your data from backups (if you don't backup your database, <strong>stop reading right now and fix that immediately</strong>). But that's clumsy.</p>
<p>So by only storing the current state of the object, you lose all the contextual information on how the object arrived at this current state. Not only that, you make it difficult to make projections about the future.</p>
<p>Event sourcing <sup id="fnref-1"><a class="footnote-ref" href="https://www.djangoproject.com/rss/community/blogs/#fn-1">1</a></sup> can help with that.</p>
<h2>Event sourcing</h2>
<p>The basic concept of event sourcing is this:</p>
<ul>
<li>Instead of just storing the current state, we also store the <em>events</em> that lead up to the current state</li>
<li>Events are replayable. We can travel back in time to any point by replaying every event up to that point in time</li>
<li>That also means we can recover the current state just by replaying every event, even if the current state was accidentally deleted</li>
<li>Events are <em>append-only</em>. </li>
</ul>
<p>To gain an intuition, let's look at an event sourcing system you're familiar with: your bank account.</p>
<p>Your "state" is your account balance, while your "events" are your transactions (deposit, withdrawal, etc.). </p>
<p>Can you imagine a bank account that only shows you the current balance? </p>
<p>That is clearly unacceptable ("Why do I only have $50? Where did my money go? If only I could see the the history."). So we always store the history of transfers as the source of truth.</p>
<h2>Implementing event sourcing in Django</h2>
<p>Let's look at a few ways to do this in Django.</p>
<h3>Ad-hoc models</h3>
<p>If you have a one or two important models, you probably don't need a generalizable event sourcing solution that applies to all models. </p>
<p>You could do it on an ad-hoc basis like this, if you can have a relationship that makes sense:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="c1"># in an app called 'account'</span>
<span class="kn">from</span> <span class="nn">django.db</span> <span class="kn">import</span> <span class="n">models</span>
<span class="kn">from</span> <span class="nn">django.conf</span> <span class="kn">import</span> <span class="n">settings</span>


<span class="k">class</span> <span class="nc">Account</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">models</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">Model</span><span class="p">):</span>
    <span class="sd">&quot;&quot;&quot;Bank account&quot;&quot;&quot;</span>
    <span class="n">balance</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">models</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">DecimalField</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">max_digits</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="mi">19</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">decimal_places</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="mi">6</span><span class="p">)</span>
    <span class="n">owner</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">models</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">ForeignKey</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">settings</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">AUTH_USER_MODEL</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">related_name</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s1">'account'</span><span class="p">)</span>


<span class="k">class</span> <span class="nc">Transfer</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">models</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">Model</span><span class="p">):</span>
    <span class="sd">&quot;&quot;&quot;</span>
<span class="sd">    Represents a transfer in or out of an account. A positive amount indicates</span>
<span class="sd">    that it is a transfer into the account, whereas a negative amount indicates</span>
<span class="sd">    that it is a transfer out of the account.</span>
<span class="sd">    &quot;&quot;&quot;</span>
    <span class="n">account</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">models</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">ForeignKey</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s1">'account.Account'</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">on_delete</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="n">models</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">PROTECT</span><span class="p">,</span> 
                                <span class="n">related_name</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s1">'transfers'</span><span class="p">)</span>
    <span class="n">amount</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">models</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">DecimalField</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">max_digits</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="mi">19</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">decimal_places</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="mi">6</span><span class="p">)</span>
    <span class="n">date</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">models</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">DateTimeField</span><span class="p">()</span>
</pre></div>


<p>In this case your "state" is in your <code>Account</code> model, whereas your <code>Transfer</code> model contains the "events".</p>
<p>Having <code>Transfer</code> objects makes it trivial to recreate any account.</p>
<h3>Using an Event Store</h3>
<p>You could also use a single <code>Event</code> model to store every possible event in any model. A nice way to do this is to encode the changes in a JSON field. </p>
<p>This example uses Postgres:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="kn">from</span> <span class="nn">django.contrib.contenttypes.fields</span> <span class="kn">import</span> <span class="n">GenericForeignKey</span>
<span class="kn">from</span> <span class="nn">django.contrib.contenttypes.models</span> <span class="kn">import</span> <span class="n">ContentType</span>
<span class="kn">from</span> <span class="nn">django.contrib.postgres.fields</span> <span class="kn">import</span> <span class="n">JSONField</span>
<span class="kn">from</span> <span class="nn">django.db</span> <span class="kn">import</span> <span class="n">models</span>


<span class="k">class</span> <span class="nc">Event</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">models</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">Model</span><span class="p">):</span>
    <span class="sd">&quot;&quot;&quot;Event table that stores all model changes&quot;&quot;&quot;</span>
    <span class="n">content_type</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">models</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">ForeignKey</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">ContentType</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">on_delete</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="n">models</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">PROTECT</span><span class="p">)</span>
    <span class="n">object_id</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">models</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">PositiveIntegerField</span><span class="p">()</span>
    <span class="n">time_created</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">models</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">DateTimeField</span><span class="p">()</span>
    <span class="n">content_object</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">GenericForeignKey</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s1">'content_type'</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s1">'object_id'</span><span class="p">)</span>
    <span class="n">body</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">JSONField</span><span class="p">()</span>
</pre></div>


<p>You can then add methods to any model that mutates the state:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="k">class</span> <span class="nc">Account</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">models</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">Model</span><span class="p">):</span>
    <span class="n">balance</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">models</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">DecimalField</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">max_digits</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="mi">19</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">decimal_places</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="mi">6</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">default</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="mi">0</span>
    <span class="n">owner</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">models</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">ForeignKey</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">settings</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">AUTH_USER_MODEL</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">related_name</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s1">'account'</span><span class="p">)</span>

<p>Again, this makes it trivial to write any utility methods to recreate any instance of <code>Account</code>, even if you accidentally dropped the whole accounts table.</p>
<h2>Snapshotting</h2>
<p>There will come a time when you have too many events to efficiently replay the entire history. In this case, a good optimisation step would be <em>snapshots</em> taken at various points in history. For example, in our accounting example one could save snapshots of the account in an <code>AccountBalance</code> model, which is a snapshot of the account's state at a point in time.</p>
<p>You could do this via a scheduled task. Celery <sup id="fnref-2"><a class="footnote-ref" href="https://www.djangoproject.com/rss/community/blogs/#fn-2">2</a></sup> is a good option.</p>
<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>Use event sourcing to maintain an append-only list of events for your critical data. This effectively allows you to travel in time to any point in history to see the state of your data at that time. </p>

<p>That estimate on the HashAggregate certainly looks wonky, doesn&#8217;t it?  Just 200 rows even with a huge number of rows below it?</p>

<p>What if we cut down the number of partitions being hit?</p>

<p>Still 200 exactly.  OK, that&#8217;s bizarre.  Let&#8217;s select exactly one partition:</p>

<p>Still 200 exactly.  What happens if we select from the child directly?</p>

<pre><code>test=&gt; explain select distinct id from orders_20160509;
                                     QUERY PLAN

(3 rows)
</code></pre>

<p>A much more reasonable estimate. So, what&#8217;s going on?</p>

<p>That 200 should be something of a flag, as that&#8217;s a compiled-in constant that PostgreSQL uses when it doesn&#8217;t have ndistinct information for a particular table, usually because there are no statistics collected on a table.</p>

<p>In this case, the issue was that an ANALYZE had never been done on the parent table. This isn&#8217;t surprising: Autovacuum would never hit that table, since (like most parent tables in a partition set), it has no rows and is never updated or inserted to. That lack-of-information gets passed up through the Append node, and the HashAggregate just uses the default 200.</p>

<p>Sure enough, when the parent table was ANALYZE&#8217;d, the estimates became much more reasonable.</p>

<p>So: It can pay to do an initial ANALYZE on a newly created partitioned table so that the planner gets statistics for the parent table, even if those statistics are &#8220;no rows here.&#8221;</p>

        <p>One of the most common questions from new PostgreSQL users is &#8220;how do I connect to the database server?&#8221; The nuances of pg_hba.conf and how to correctly enable your Python web app to connect to your db server without opening up connections to all users and all servers is not <em>simple</em> for someone new to Postgres. And architecting a secure multi-tenant SaaS system requires knowledge of how roles, schemas, databases, and search paths interact. That&#8217;s one reason we wrote a <a href="http://www.openscg.com/whitepapers/postgresql-security-guidelines-case-study-whitepaper/">Security Whitepaper</a> a while back.</p>
<p>But, after seeing thousands of <a href="http://www.csoonline.com/article/3154190/security/exposed-mongodb-installs-being-erased-held-for-ransom.html">MongoDB instances taken hostage by ransomware</a> the &#8220;no authorization required&#8221; default for MongoDB is looking like a very dumb idea. Just imagine what executives whose developers picked MongoDB are saying today:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&#8220;You mean we store our client list in a database without security?</p>
<p>&#8220;Anyone can just delete our NoSQL database from the internet?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Were we hacked last year when you said we lost data in MongoDB?&#8221;</p>

<p>So, a quick <strong>&#8220;Thank You&#8221;</strong> to PostgreSQL for making sure that your data is Secure By Default.</p>

        <p>Mirror mirror on the wall,<br />
Who is the fairest Database of all?</p>
<p>A frequently asked question, certainly.</p>
<p>DB-Engines recently announced it&#8217;s DBMS of the Year. Maybe the cool thing is that PostgreSQL is in 3rd Place. Yee-ha, an open source project is up there!</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s look closely about what this means.</p>
<p>PostgreSQL.org&#8217;s agreed response was this&#8230;</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;It&#8217;s great to see the continued success of PostgreSQL being reflected in DB-Engines rankings. It&#8217;s clear that the strength of the following for the World&#8217;s Most Advanced Open Source Database is enough to outweigh the largest software companies as people continue to choose to move away from commercial databases.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>though because of commercial sensitivity this was changed down to this</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;It&#8217;s great to see the continued success of PostgreSQL being reflected in DB-Engines rankings. It&#8217;s clear that the strength of the following for the World&#8217;s Most Advanced Open Source Database is enough to draw people away from commercial databases.&#8221;
</p></blockquote>
<p>What were the commercial sensitivities? (What about &#8220;open source sensitivies&#8221;? Well, blame me, cos I agreed the change.)</p>
<p>Well, the title of the post is that a Microsoft product is actually DBMS of the Year, even though it&#8217;s not ranked #1 on the main list, that&#8217;s still Oracle. And Postgres is #3 on DBMS of the Year, even though we moved through to #5 again, competing with MongoDB for position 4 (although mostly level).</p>
<p>My guess is that Microsoft would like to highlight how it gets more press than PostgreSQL, a point I would concede in an instant. Whether that means it is more popular or has better features is a different thing entirely. People are simply leaving commercial databases in droves to come to PostgreSQL, which is clearly reflected in the very public decline of Oracle licencing revenues over the last 10 quarters and I&#8217;m sure its just the same for Microsoft revenue.</p>
<p>The purpose of the announcement from PostgreSQL.org was to highlight that &#8220;the strength of the following for the World&#8217;s Most Advanced Open Source Database is enough to outweigh the largest software companies&#8221;, though my conclusion is that we are not YET in a position to do that. Larger marketing budget does still give a larger audience. Real world usage does still show PostgreSQL usage increasing at an amazing rate. And our technology continues to set the pace of feature development that other databases would like to achieve.</p>
<p>Number 3 means we&#8217;re on the list. We can discuss exactly place we&#8217;re at, but its enough to put us on the short list for every major technology decision, worldwide. And when people see the feature list, price and responsive support, the effect is compelling.</p>
<p>Anyway, ain&#8217;t no such thing as bad publicity, so we&#8217;re all happy.</p>
<p>Thanks very much to DBEngines for mentioning PostgreSQL in this post&#8230;<br />

        <p>Unlike other database systems, Postgres makes the cleanup process visible and tunable to users. 
<a class="major" href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.6/static/routine-vacuuming.html#AUTOVACUUM" style="text-decoration: underline;">Autovacuum</a> performs recycling of old rows and updates
optimizer statistics.  It appears in <a class="txt2html" href="http://www.linfo.org/ps.html" style="text-decoration: none;"><em>ps</em></a> command output, the
<a class="txt2html" href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.6/static/monitoring-stats.html#MONITORING-STATS-VIEWS" style="text-decoration: none;"><em>pg_stat_activity</em></a> system view,  and
optionally in the server logs via
<a class="txt2html" href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.6/static/runtime-config-autovacuum.html" style="text-decoration: none;"><em>log_autovacuum_min_duration.</em></a>
</p>
<p>Postgres also allows fine-grained <a class="txt2html" href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.6/static/runtime-config-autovacuum.html" style="text-decoration: none;">control</a> over the
autovacuum cleanup process.  Occasionally users find that cleanup is slowing the system down, and rather than modifying the behavior of
autovacuum, they decide to turn it off via the
<a class="txt2html" href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.6/static/runtime-config-autovacuum.html" style="text-decoration: none;"><em>autovacuum</em></a> setting.  
</p>
<p>However, turning off autovacuum can cause problems.  Initially the system will run faster since there is no cleanup overhead, but after a
while old rows will clog up user tables and indexes, leading to increasing slowness.  Once that happens, you can turn on autovacuum again,
and it will recycle the old rows and free up space, but there will be much unused space that can't be reused quickly, or perhaps ever.

        <p>Django comes with "batteries included" to make CRUD (create, read, update, delete) operations easy. It's nice that the CR part (create and read) of CRUD is so easy, but have you ever paused to think about the UD part (update and delete)?</p>
<p>Let's look at delete. All you need to do is this:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="n">ReallyImportantModel</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">objects</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">get</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nb">id</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="mi">32</span><span class="p">)</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">delete</span><span class="p">()</span>  <span class="c1"># gone from the database forever</span>
</pre></div>


<p>Just one line, and your data is gone forever. It can be done accidentally. Or you can be do it deliberately, only to later realise that your old data is valuable too.</p>
<p>Now what about updating? </p>
<p><em>Updating is deleting in disguise</em>. </p>
<p>When you update, you're deleting the old data and replacing it with something new. <em>It's still deletion</em>.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="n">important</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">ReallyImportantModel</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">object</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">get</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nb">id</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="mi">32</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="n">important</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">update</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">data</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="p">{</span><span class="s1">'new_data'</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="s1">'This is new data'</span><span class="p">})</span>  <span class="c1"># OLD DATA GONE FOREVER</span>
</pre></div>


<p>Okay, but why do we care?</p>
<p>Let's say we want to know the state of <code>ReallyImportantModel</code> 6 months ago. Oh that's right, you've deleted it, so you can't get it back. </p>
<p>Well, that's not exactly true -- you can recreate your data from backups (if you don't backup your database, <strong>stop reading right now and fix that immediately</strong>). But that's clumsy.</p>
<p>So by only storing the current state of the object, you lose all the contextual information on how the object arrived at this current state. Not only that, you make it difficult to make projections about the future.</p>
<p>Event sourcing <sup id="fnref-1"><a class="footnote-ref" href="https://www.djangoproject.com/rss/community/blogs/#fn-1">1</a></sup> can help with that.</p>
<h2>Event sourcing</h2>
<p>The basic concept of event sourcing is this:</p>
<ul>
<li>Instead of just storing the current state, we also store the <em>events</em> that lead up to the current state</li>
<li>Events are replayable. We can travel back in time to any point by replaying every event up to that point in time</li>
<li>That also means we can recover the current state just by replaying every event, even if the current state was accidentally deleted</li>
<li>Events are <em>append-only</em>. </li>
</ul>
<p>To gain an intuition, let's look at an event sourcing system you're familiar with: your bank account.</p>
<p>Your "state" is your account balance, while your "events" are your transactions (deposit, withdrawal, etc.). </p>
<p>Can you imagine a bank account that only shows you the current balance? </p>
<p>That is clearly unacceptable ("Why do I only have $50? Where did my money go? If only I could see the the history."). So we always store the history of transfers as the source of truth.</p>
<h2>Implementing event sourcing in Django</h2>
<p>Let's look at a few ways to do this in Django.</p>
<h3>Ad-hoc models</h3>
<p>If you have a one or two important models, you probably don't need a generalizable event sourcing solution that applies to all models. </p>
<p>You could do it on an ad-hoc basis like this, if you can have a relationship that makes sense:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="c1"># in an app called 'account'</span>
<span class="kn">from</span> <span class="nn">django.db</span> <span class="kn">import</span> <span class="n">models</span>
<span class="kn">from</span> <span class="nn">django.conf</span> <span class="kn">import</span> <span class="n">settings</span>


<span class="k">class</span> <span class="nc">Account</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">models</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">Model</span><span class="p">):</span>
    <span class="sd">&quot;&quot;&quot;Bank account&quot;&quot;&quot;</span>
    <span class="n">balance</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">models</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">DecimalField</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">max_digits</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="mi">19</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">decimal_places</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="mi">6</span><span class="p">)</span>
    <span class="n">owner</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">models</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">ForeignKey</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">settings</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">AUTH_USER_MODEL</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">related_name</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s1">'account'</span><span class="p">)</span>


<span class="k">class</span> <span class="nc">Transfer</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">models</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">Model</span><span class="p">):</span>
    <span class="sd">&quot;&quot;&quot;</span>
<span class="sd">    Represents a transfer in or out of an account. A positive amount indicates</span>
<span class="sd">    that it is a transfer into the account, whereas a negative amount indicates</span>
<span class="sd">    that it is a transfer out of the account.</span>
<span class="sd">    &quot;&quot;&quot;</span>
    <span class="n">account</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">models</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">ForeignKey</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s1">'account.Account'</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">on_delete</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="n">models</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">PROTECT</span><span class="p">,</span> 
                                <span class="n">related_name</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s1">'transfers'</span><span class="p">)</span>
    <span class="n">amount</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">models</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">DecimalField</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">max_digits</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="mi">19</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">decimal_places</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="mi">6</span><span class="p">)</span>
    <span class="n">date</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">models</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">DateTimeField</span><span class="p">()</span>
</pre></div>


<p>In this case your "state" is in your <code>Account</code> model, whereas your <code>Transfer</code> model contains the "events".</p>
<p>Having <code>Transfer</code> objects makes it trivial to recreate any account.</p>
<h3>Using an Event Store</h3>
<p>You could also use a single <code>Event</code> model to store every possible event in any model. A nice way to do this is to encode the changes in a JSON field. </p>
<p>This example uses Postgres:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="kn">from</span> <span class="nn">django.contrib.contenttypes.fields</span> <span class="kn">import</span> <span class="n">GenericForeignKey</span>
<span class="kn">from</span> <span class="nn">django.contrib.contenttypes.models</span> <span class="kn">import</span> <span class="n">ContentType</span>
<span class="kn">from</span> <span class="nn">django.contrib.postgres.fields</span> <span class="kn">import</span> <span class="n">JSONField</span>
<span class="kn">from</span> <span class="nn">django.db</span> <span class="kn">import</span> <span class="n">models</span>


<span class="k">class</span> <span class="nc">Event</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">models</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">Model</span><span class="p">):</span>
    <span class="sd">&quot;&quot;&quot;Event table that stores all model changes&quot;&quot;&quot;</span>
    <span class="n">content_type</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">models</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">ForeignKey</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">ContentType</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">on_delete</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="n">models</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">PROTECT</span><span class="p">)</span>
    <span class="n">object_id</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">models</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">PositiveIntegerField</span><span class="p">()</span>
    <span class="n">time_created</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">models</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">DateTimeField</span><span class="p">()</span>
    <span class="n">content_object</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">GenericForeignKey</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s1">'content_type'</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s1">'object_id'</span><span class="p">)</span>
    <span class="n">body</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">JSONField</span><span class="p">()</span>
</pre></div>


<p>You can then add methods to any model that mutates the state:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="k">class</span> <span class="nc">Account</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">models</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">Model</span><span class="p">):</span>
    <span class="n">balance</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">models</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">DecimalField</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">max_digits</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="mi">19</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">decimal_places</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="mi">6</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">default</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="mi">0</span>
    <span class="n">owner</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">models</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">ForeignKey</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">settings</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">AUTH_USER_MODEL</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">related_name</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s1">'account'</span><span class="p">)</span>

    <span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">make_deposit</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="bp">self</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">amount</span><span class="p">):</span>

        <span class="sd">&quot;&quot;&quot;Create an account&quot;&quot;&quot;</span>

        <span class="n">Event</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">objects</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">create</span><span class="p">(</span>
            <span class="n">content_object</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="n">account</span><span class="p">,</span>
            <span class="n">time_created</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="n">timezone</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">now</span><span class="p">(),</span>

                <span class="s1">'type'</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="s1">'created_account'</span><span class="p">,</span>
                <span class="s1">'id'</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="n">account</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">id</span><span class="p">,</span>

        <span class="p">)</span>
        <span class="k">return</span> <span class="n">account</span>
</pre></div>


<p>So now you can do this:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="n">account</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">Account</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">create_account</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">owner</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="n">User</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">objects</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">first</span><span class="p">())</span>

<span class="n">events</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">Event</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">objects</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">filter</span><span class="p">(</span>
    <span class="n">content_type</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="n">ContentType</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">objects</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">get_for_model</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">account</span><span class="p">),</span> 
    <span class="n">object_id</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="n">account</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">id</span>
<span class="p">)</span>

<span class="k">for</span> <span class="n">event</span> <span class="ow">in</span> <span class="n">events</span><span class="p">:</span>
    <span class="k">print</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">event</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">body</span><span class="p">)</span>
</pre></div>


<p>Which should give you this:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="p">{</span><span class="nt">&quot;type&quot;</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="s2">&quot;created_account&quot;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="nt">&quot;id&quot;</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="mi">2</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="nt">&quot;owner_id&quot;</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">}</span>

</pre></div>


<p>Again, this makes it trivial to write any utility methods to recreate any instance of <code>Account</code>, even if you accidentally dropped the whole accounts table.</p>
<h2>Snapshotting</h2>
<p>There will come a time when you have too many events to efficiently replay the entire history. In this case, a good optimisation step would be <em>snapshots</em> taken at various points in history. For example, in our accounting example one could save snapshots of the account in an <code>AccountBalance</code> model, which is a snapshot of the account's state at a point in time.</p>
<p>You could do this via a scheduled task. Celery <sup id="fnref-2"><a class="footnote-ref" href="https://www.djangoproject.com/rss/community/blogs/#fn-2">2</a></sup> is a good option.</p>
<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>Use event sourcing to maintain an append-only list of events for your critical data. This effectively allows you to travel in time to any point in history to see the state of your data at that time. </p>

        <p>As we say welcome to a new year, we have a couple of updates to the finances and payment handling in PostgreSQL Europe, that will affect our members and attendees of our events.</p>
<p>First of all, PostgreSQL Europe has unfortunately been forced to VAT register. This means that most of our invoices (details below) will now include VAT.</p>
<p>Second, we have enabled a new payment provider for those of you that can't or prefer not to use credit cards but that still allows for fast payments.</p>

        <p>A few weeks back, I noticed the following tweet from Michael Paquier:</p>
<p><img alt="tweet" src="https://photos.smugmug.com/photos/i-8qDK7XB/0/O/i-8qDK7XB.png" /></p>
<p>And my first thought was "that can't be right" (spoiler: Turns out it wasn't. But almost.)</p>
<p>The second thought was "hmm, I wonder how that has actually changed over time". And of course, with today being a day off and generally "slow pace" (ahem), what better way than to analyze the data that we have. The <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/list/">PostgreSQL mailinglist archives</a> are all stored in a PostgreSQL database of course, so running the analytics is a quick job.</p>

            <h2>Django - Database access optimization</h2>
        </a>

        <p class="discreet">
            
                  By Micropyramid django from Django community aggregator: Community blog posts.

        </p>

        <p style="font-style: italic;"><a href="https://micropyramid.com/django-development-services/">Django</a> Queryset is generally lazy in nature. It will not hit the database until it &nbsp;evaluates the query results.</p>

<p>Example:</p>

<pre class="prettyprint">
queryset = User.objects.all() # It won't hit the database
print (queryset) &nbsp;# Now, ORM turns the query into raw sql &nbsp;and fetches results from the database</pre>

<h2>1.Caching and QuerySets</h2>

<p>Generally Django stores the query results in the catche when it fetches the results for the first time.</p>

<p>Example:&nbsp;<span style="line-height: 1.6;">Get all users first names list &nbsp;and emails list from the database.</span></p>

<pre class="prettyprint">
first_names_list = [ user.first_name for user in User.objects.all()]
emails_list =&nbsp;[ user.email for user in User.objects.all()]</pre>

<p>above code hits the database twice. To avoid the extra request to the database we can use the Django's database cache in the following way.</p>

<pre class="prettyprint">
users_list =&nbsp;User.objects.all() &nbsp; &nbsp;# No database activity
first_names_list =&nbsp;&nbsp;[user.first_name for user in users_list] &nbsp; &nbsp;# Hits the database and stores the results in the cache
emails_list =&nbsp;[user.email for user in&nbsp;users_list] &nbsp; &nbsp;# uses the results from the cache.</pre>

<p>other way is&nbsp;</p>

<pre class="prettyprint">
users_list =&nbsp;User.objects.all()
db = dict(users_list.values_list(&quot;first_name&quot;, &quot;email&quot;))
first_names_list,&nbsp;emails_list = db.keys(), db.values()</pre>

<p><span style="line-height: 1.6;"><em>Note: Querysets are not cached if query is not evaluated.</em><br />
Eaxmple: If you want to take a subset/part of the query results</span></p>

<pre class="prettyprint">
queryset = Users.objects.all()
first_five =&nbsp;queryset[:5] &nbsp; &nbsp;# Hits the database
first_ten =&nbsp;queryset[:10] &nbsp; &nbsp;# Hits the database</pre>

<p>If you want to use the cache in the above situation you can do it in the following way</p>

<pre class="prettyprint">
queryset = Users.objects.all()
bool(queryset) &nbsp;# queryset is evaluated &nbsp;and results are cached
first_five =&nbsp;queryset[:5] &nbsp; &nbsp;# &nbsp;uses the cache
first_ten =&nbsp;queryset[:10] &nbsp; &nbsp;# uses the cache</pre>

<h2>2. Complex Database Queries with &quot;Q&quot; objects</h2>

<p><span style="line-height: 1.6;">Django Queries uses &quot;AND&quot; caluse to fetch results when using filter.<br />
Example:</span></p>

<pre class="prettyprint">
User.objects.filter(email__contains=&quot;adam&quot;, first_name=&quot;Adam&quot;)
# equivalent SQL Qurery is
SELECT * FROM user_table WHERE email LIKE '%adam%' &nbsp;AND first_name=Adam;</pre>

<p><span style="line-height: 1.6;">If you want to filter the users &nbsp;email starts with &quot;an&quot; or &quot;sa&quot;<br />
Simple Example:</span></p>

<pre class="prettyprint">
users_list = User.objects.all()
filtered_users = []
for user in users_list:
&nbsp; &nbsp; if user.email.startswith(&quot;an&quot;) &nbsp;or &nbsp;user.email.startswith(&quot;sa&quot;):
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;filtered_users.append(user)</pre>

<p><span style="line-height: 1.6;">In above example it gets all the records from the table. Insted, we can fetch the records that we required by using the &quot;Q&quot; object.</span><br />
Example:</p>

<pre class="prettyprint">
from django.db.models import Q
users_list = User.objects.filter(Q(email__startswith=&quot;an&quot;) | Q(email__startswith=&quot;sa&quot;))
#&nbsp;equivalent SQL Qurery is
SELECT * FROM user_table WHERE email LIKE 'an%' OR email LIKE 'sa%'</pre>

<p><span style="line-height: 1.6;">Q object usuage:</span></p>

<pre class="prettyprint">
~Q(email__startswith=&quot;an&quot;) &nbsp;# email don't starts with &quot;an&quot;&nbsp;
# SQL &nbsp;equivalent
| &nbsp;= OR
&amp; = AND
~ = NOT

</pre>

<p>We can use parenthesis with &quot;Q&quot; object<br />
Example:</p>

<pre class="prettyprint">
Model.objects.filter((Q(key1=&quot;value1&quot;) &amp; ~Q(key2=&quot;value2&quot;)) |&nbsp;(~Q(key3=&quot;value&quot;))</pre>

<h2>3. Create Multiple Objects at once with Bulk Create</h2>

<p>Simple Example: To create 4 users</p>

<pre class="prettyprint">
users_details = [
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;(&quot;Dinesh&quot;, &quot;dinesh@micropyramid.com&quot;),
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;(&quot;Ravi&quot;, &quot;ravi@micropyramid.com&quot;),
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;(&quot;Santharao&quot;, &quot;santharao@micropyramid.com&quot;),
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;(&quot;Shera&quot;, &quot;shera@micropyramid.com&quot;)
]
for first_name, email in users_details:
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; User.objects.create(first_name=first_name, email=email)</pre>

<p>Above example hits/request the database 4 times to create 4 users, but we can create 4 users with single database hit/request.<br />
Example:</p>

<pre class="prettyprint">
instance_list = [User(first_name=first_name, email=email) for first_name, email in users_details]
User.objects.bulk_create(instance_list)</pre>

<h2>4. Update Multiple Objects or a filtered Queryset at once with update</h2>

<p>Let us consider Employee model as</p>

<pre class="prettyprint">
from django.db import models

DESIGNATIONS =&nbsp;((&quot;Designer&quot;, &quot;Designer&quot;),
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; (&quot;Developer&quot;, &quot;Developer&quot;),
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; (&quot;HR&quot;, &quot;HR&quot;))

class Employee(models.Model):
&nbsp; &nbsp; name = models.CharField(max_length=30)
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;email = models.EmailField(max_length=30)
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;designation =&nbsp;models.CharField(max_length=30, choices=DESIGNATIONS)
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;salary = models.DecimalField(default=20000)
&nbsp;</pre>

<p>After one year manager wants to increase the salary for Developers at an amount of 5000</p>

<p>SimpleExample:</p>

<pre class="prettyprint">
developers =&nbsp;Employee.objects.filter(designation=&quot;Developer&quot;)
for developer in developers:
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;developer.salary =&nbsp;developer.salary + 5000
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;develope
r.save()

</pre>

<p>Above example hits the database for several times[i.e number of developers]. we can do this with a single database hit/request.</p>

<p>Example:</p>

<pre class="prettyprint">
from django.db.models import F

amount = 5000
developers =&nbsp;Employee.objects.filter(designation=&quot;Developer&quot;)
developers.update(salary=F(&quot;salary&quot;)+amount)</pre>

<h2>5. Select only required fields in the query from the database to decrease querying time&nbsp;</h2>

<p>We use this when we need only the data[ie. fields values] &nbsp;we dont get access to the model functions and relational objects. We can do this by using&nbsp;QuerySet.values() and <strong><span style="line-height: 20.8px;">QuerySet.</span>values_list()</strong></p>

<p><strong style="line-height: 20.8px;">QuerySet.values()</strong><span style="line-height: 20.8px;">&nbsp;</span>&nbsp;returns the list of dictionaries. Each dictionary represents an instance of object.<br />
<strong style="line-height: 20.8px;"><span style="line-height: 20.8px;">QuerySet.</span>values_list()&nbsp;</strong><span style="line-height: 20.8px;">returns the list of&nbsp;</span>tuples. Each tutple&nbsp;<span style="line-height: 20.8px;">represents an instance of object. order of values in the tuple is id followed by the fields in the model.</span></p>

<pre class="prettyprint">
from .models import&nbsp;Employee
# create 2 objects
Employee.objects.create(name=&quot;Ravi&quot;, email=&quot;ravi@micropramid.com&quot;, designation=&quot;Developer&quot;, salary=30000)
Employee.objects.create(name=&quot;Santharao&quot;, email=&quot;santharao@micropramid.com&quot;, designation=&quot;Designer&quot;, salary=40000)

queryset =&nbsp;Employee.objects.all() &nbsp; &nbsp;# you can also use filter&nbsp;
# Example for &nbsp;QuerySet.values()
users_dict_list =&nbsp;queryset.values()
# above line is equivalent to
users_dict_list = [
&nbsp; &nbsp; {
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;id&quot;: 1,
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &quot;name&quot;: &quot;Ravi&quot;,
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &quot;email&quot;: &quot;ravi@micropramid.com&quot;,
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &quot;designation&quot;: &quot;Developer&quot;,
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &quot;salary&quot;: 30000
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; },
&nbsp; &nbsp; {
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;id&quot;: 2,
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &quot;name&quot;: &quot;Santharao&quot;,
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &quot;email&quot;: &quot;santharao@micropramid.com&quot;,
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &quot;designation&quot;: &quot;Designer&quot;,
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &quot;salary&quot;:&nbsp;40000
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; },
]
<em># To &nbsp;get only required fields data ie. &nbsp;&quot;name&quot;, &quot;salary&quot;</em>
users_dict_list =&nbsp;queryset.values(&quot;name&quot;, &quot;salary&quot;)
# above line is equivalent to
users_dict_list = [
&nbsp; &nbsp; {
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &quot;name&quot;: &quot;Ravi&quot;,
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &quot;salary&quot;: 30000
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; },
&nbsp; &nbsp; {
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &quot;name&quot;: &quot;Santharao&quot;,
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &quot;salary&quot;:&nbsp;40000
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; },
]

users_tuple_list = [
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;(1, &quot;Ravi&quot;, &quot;ravi@micropramid.com&quot;,&nbsp;&quot;Developer&quot;,&nbsp;30000),
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;(2, &quot;Santharao&quot;,&nbsp;&quot;santharao@micropramid.com&quot;,&nbsp;&quot;Designer&quot;, 40000),
]
<em style="line-height: 20.8px;"># To &nbsp;get only required fields data ie. &nbsp;&quot;name&quot;, &quot;salary&quot;</em>
users_tuple_list =&nbsp;queryset.values_list(&quot;name&quot;, &quot;salary&quot;)

users_tuple_list = [
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;(&quot;Ravi&quot;, 30000),

]
<em style="line-height: 20.8px;"># We can also get list of values of a single field in the model by setting&nbsp;<ins>&quot;flat=True&quot;</ins></em>
users_names_list =&nbsp;queryset.values_list(&quot;name&quot;, flat=True) &nbsp; &nbsp; # it works only for single field
# above line is equivalent to
users_names_list = [&quot;Ravi&quot;, &quot;Santharao&quot;]
&nbsp;

</pre>
5. Dont hit/request the database for related objects. Fetch all related objects in a single query using&nbsp;select_related&nbsp;and&nbsp;prefetch_related Let us consider the following models

<pre class="prettyprint">
from django.db import models

class Address(models.Model):
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; city = models.CharField(max_length=100)
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; state = &nbsp;models.CharField(max_length=100)
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;pin = &nbsp;models.CharField(max_length=100)

class Person(models.Model):
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;name = models.CharField(max_length=100)
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; email = models.EmailField(max_length=100)
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;present_address = models.ForeignKey(Address)
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;previous_address = models.ForeignKey(Address)

class Book(models.Model):
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;name = models.CharField(max_length=100)
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;author = models.ForeignKey(Person)
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;publishers = models.ManyToManyField(Person)

</pre>

<h3>usuage of select_related</h3>

<pre class="prettyprint">
# without select related
person = Person.objects.get(id=1)
present_address = person.present_address &nbsp;#&nbsp;Hits the database.
previous_address&nbsp;= person.previous_address&nbsp; #&nbsp;Hits the database.
# total database hits = 3
# with select related
person = Person.objects.select_related().get(id=1)
present_address&nbsp;= person.present_address #&nbsp;<em>Doesn't hit the database.</em>
previous_address&nbsp;= person.previous_address&nbsp;#&nbsp;<em>Doesn't hit the database.
# total database hits = 1</em>
# you can also select the specific related objects
person = Person.objects.select_related(&quot;present_address&quot;).get(id=1)
present_address&nbsp;= person.present_address #&nbsp;<em style="line-height: 20.8px;">Doesn't hit the database.</em>
previous_address&nbsp;= person.previous_address #&nbsp;Hits the database.

</pre>

<h3>Limitaions of&nbsp;select_related</h3>

<p>select_related works by creating an SQL join and including the fields of the related object in the SELECT statement. For this reason, select_related gets the related objects in the same database query. However, to avoid the much larger result set that would result from joining across a &lsquo;many&rsquo; relationship, select_related is <strong>limited</strong> <strong>to</strong> single-valued relationships - <strong>foreign key</strong> and <strong>one-to-one</strong>.<br />
<br />
Usuage of&nbsp;prefetch_related</p>

<div>
<pre class="prettyprint">
# without prefetch related
book = Book.objects.get(id=1)
author&nbsp;= book.author<span style="line-height: 20.8px;">&nbsp;#&nbsp;</span>Hits the database.
publishers<span style="line-height: 20.8px;">&nbsp;= book</span><span span="" style="line-height: 20.8px;"><span style="line-height: 20.8px;">&nbsp;#&nbsp;Hits the database.
# total database hits = 3</span>
# with prefetch related
book =&nbsp;</span>Book.objects.prefetch_related().get(id=1)
author&nbsp;=&nbsp;book.author<span style="line-height: 20.8px;">&nbsp; #&nbsp;</span><em>Doesn't hit the database.</em>
publishers<span style="line-height: 20.8px;">&nbsp;=&nbsp;book</span><span style="line-height: 20.8px;">.publishers.all()</span><span style="line-height: 20.8px;">&nbsp;#&nbsp;</span><em>Doesn't hit the database.
<span style="line-height: 20.8px;"># total database hits = 1</span></em>
# you can also select the specific related objects
book =&nbsp;Book.objects.prefetch_related(&quot;publishers&quot;).get(id=1)
author&nbsp;=&nbsp;book.author<span style="line-height: 20.8px;">&nbsp; #&nbsp;</span><em style="line-height: 20.8px;">Doesn't hit the database.</em>
publishers<span style="line-height: 20.8px;">&nbsp;=&nbsp;book</span><span style="line-height: 20.8px;">.publishers.all() </span><span style="line-height: 20.8px;">#&nbsp;</span>Hits the database.

</pre>
</div>

<h3>Advantage over&nbsp;select_related</h3>

<p><em><strong style="line-height: 20.8px;">prefetch_related</strong><strong style="line-height: 20.8px;">&nbsp;</strong></em>does a separate lookup for each relationship, and does the &lsquo;joining&rsquo; in Python. <em style="line-height: 20.8px;"><strong style="line-height: 20.8px;">prefetch_related</strong></em> allows it to prefetch <strong>many-to-many</strong> and <strong>many-to-one</strong> objects, which cannot be done using select_related, in addition to the foreign key and one-to-one relationships that are supported by select_related. It also supports prefetching of <strong>GenericRelation</strong> and <strong>GenericForeignKey</strong></p>

<h3>Limitaions of&nbsp;prefetch_related</h3>

<p><em><strong>prefetching</strong></em> of related objects referenced by a <em><strong>GenericForeignKey</strong></em> is only supported if the query is restricted to <strong>one ContentType.</strong></p>

<h2><span style="line-height: 1.2;">6. use queryset.count() if you require only count but not queryset objects</span></h2>

<pre class="prettyprint">
count = Book.objects.filter(author_id=5).count() &nbsp; # It returns the count(number of objects/records) only. So, operation is very fast.</pre>

<h2>7. use queryset.exists() if you want to know whether objects exists or not only</h2>

<pre class="prettyprint">
is_exists = Book.objects.filter(author_id=5).exists() &nbsp; # It returns the boolean value(True/False) only. So, operation is very fast.</pre>

<h2>8. Provide index to fields in database models &amp; provide default ordering</h2>

<p>If one of the models accessed very freequently use the indexes to the database tables.</p>

<pre class="prettyprint">
class Book(models.Model):
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;name = models.CharField(max_length=100, db_index=True)
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;author = models.ForeignKey(Person)
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; published_on = &nbsp;models.DateField()
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;publishers = models.ManyToManyField(Person)

&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;class Meta:
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; index_together = [&quot;author&quot;, &quot;published_on&quot;]
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;ordering = ['-published_on']

                  From Planet PostgreSQL.
            
            
                Published on <span name="publication_time">Dec 30, 2016</span>.
            
        </p>

        <p>The one thing that everyone knows about compositive indexes is: If you have an index on (A, B, C), it can&#8217;t be used for queries on (B) or (B, C) or (C), just (A), (A, B) or (A, B, C), right? I&#8217;ve said that multiple times in talks. It&#8217;s clearly true, right?</p>

<p>Well, no, it&#8217;s not. It&#8217;s one of those things that is not technically true, but it is still good advice.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.6/static/indexes-multicolumn.html">documentation on multi-column indexes</a> is pretty clear:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A multicolumn B-tree index can be used with query conditions that involve any subset of the index&#8217;s columns, but the index is most efficient when there are constraints on the leading (leftmost) columns. The exact rule is that equality constraints on leading columns, plus any inequality constraints on the first column that does not have an equality constraint, will be used to limit the portion of the index that is scanned. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Let&#8217;s try this out!</p>

<p>First, create a table and index:</p>

<pre><code>xof=# CREATE TABLE x ( 
xof(#     i integer,
xof(#     f float,
xof(#     g float
xof(# );
CREATE TABLE
xof=# CREATE INDEX ON x(i, f, g);
CREATE INDEX
</code></pre>

<p>And fill it with some test data:</p>

<pre><code>xof=# INSERT INTO x SELECT 1, random(), random() FROM generate_series(1, 10000000);
INSERT 0 10000000
xof=# INSERT INTO x SELECT 2, random(), random() FROM generate_series(1, 10000000);
INSERT 0 10000000
xof=# INSERT INTO x SELECT 3, random(), random() FROM generate_series(1, 10000000);
INSERT 0 10000000
xof=# ANALYZE x;
ANALYZE
</code></pre>

<p>And away we go!</p>

<pre><code>xof=# EXPLAIN ANALYZE SELECT SUM(g) FROM x WHERE f BETWEEN 0.11 AND 0.12;
                                                                   QUERY PLAN                                                                   
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Aggregate  (cost=599859.50..599859.51 rows=1 width=8) (actual time=91876.057..91876.057 rows=1 loops=1)
   -&gt;  Index Only Scan using x_i_f_g_idx on x  (cost=0.56..599097.71 rows=304716 width=8) (actual time=1820.699..91652.409 rows=300183 loops=1)
         Index Cond: ((f &gt;= '0.11'::double precision) AND (f &lt;= '0.12'::double precision))
         Heap Fetches: 300183
 Planning time: 3.384 ms
 Execution time: 91876.165 ms
(6 rows)
</code></pre>

<p>And sure enough, it uses the index, even though we didn&#8217;t include column <code>i</code> in the query. In this case, the planner thinks that this will be more efficient than just doing a sequential scan on the whole table, even though it has to walk the whole index.</p>

<p>Is it right? Let&#8217;s turn off index scans and find out.</p>

<pre><code>xof=# SET enable_indexonlyscan = 'off';
SET
xof=# EXPLAIN ANALYZE SELECT SUM(g) FROM x WHERE f BETWEEN 0.11 AND 0.12;

<p>So, we conclude:</p>

<ul>
<li>Yes, PostgreSQL will sometimes use the second and further columns of a multi-column index, even if the first column isn&#8217;t used in the query.</li>
<li>This is rarely optimal, so it should not be relied on as an optimization path.</li>
<li>So, while the advice was not correct in the absolute statement, it was still valid as advice.</li>

<p>And there we are.</p>

        </p>

        PostgreSQL allows for <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.6/static/auth-methods.html">more</a> than plain password authentication in <i><a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.6/static/auth-pg-hba-conf.html">pg_hba.conf</a></i>. One of the most flexible is authenticating against a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pluggable_authentication_module">PAM</a>.<br /><br />Let's see how this works with one-time passwords from&nbsp; <a href="https://github.com/google/google-authenticator">Google Authenticator</a>.<br /><br />1.) Install Google Authenticator on your Android or iOS device.<br /><br />2.) Install the Google Authenticator PAM on the machine where your PostgreSQL server lives, like in Step 1 - 4 of this <a href="https://www.blackmoreops.com/2014/06/26/securing-ssh-two-factor-authentication-using-google-authenticator/#Step_2_Download_Google_Authenticator_Module">guide</a>.<br /><br />3.) Connect your device with the account on that machine.<br /><br />4.) Configure a PAM service for PostgreSQL. E.g. create a file named <i>postgresql</i> where your PAM configs live, on Ubuntu this is <i>/etc/pam.d/</i>. The file should look like this:<br /><br /><pre><span>auth         sufficient     <code>pam_google_authenticator.so</code></span></pre><br />5.) Configure PostgreSQL to use the PAM. E.g. a line in <i>pg_hba.conf</i> could look like this:<br /><br /><span>hostssl&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; all&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; all&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 127.0.0.1/32&nbsp;&nbsp; pam&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; pamservice=postgresql</span><br /><br />And that's basically it. Now, next time you login, PostgreSQL will ask you for a password that is generated individually on your device.<br /><br />Of course you can use all kinds of PAM with PostgreSQL like this.<br /><br />Unfortunately, I also found a few caveats along the way. :-(<br /><br />First, PostgreSQL clients will ask only for one password, regardless if you chain <i>n</i> PAM's for n-factor authentication.<br /><br />So if you e.g. chain a PAM against LDAP with Google Authenticator as the second factor, this won't work. This seems to be a shortcoming of the PAM implementation in PostgreSQL, not expecting multiple password prompts. It is still possible to enable n-factor authentication though, but only one PAM can prompt for a password. If the other factors are hardware devices like a fingerprint scanner that does not prompt for a password, you are fine.<br /><br />Alternatively, you can provide your own PAM that takes all passwords in one prompt and handles them internally. <br /><br />Second, PAM requires PostgreSQL clients to send the password in plaintext. So <b>now</b> is the time to <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.6/static/ssl-tcp.html">switch on TLS</a> and make it mandatory (Noticed the <i>hostssl</i> switch above?).<br /><br />Third, some clients like pgAdmin3 break with one-time passwords, because they apparently open new connections without prompting for a password again, but re-use the initial one instead until you disconnect. This obviously does not work with passwords which are valid only for one login attempt.<br /><br />Fourth, if your PAM requires a physical account on the machine, but you want to map it to a different PostgreSQL user,<i> <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.6/static/auth-username-maps.html">pg_ident.conf</a></i> is your friend.

            <h2>Christophe Pettus: A Cheap and Cheerful Replication Check</h2>
        </a>

        <p class="discreet">
            
            
                  From Planet PostgreSQL.

        </p>

        <p>On a PostgreSQL primary / secondary pair, it&#8217;s very important to monitor replication lag. Increasing replication lag is often the first sign of trouble, such as a network issue, the secondary disconnecting for some reason (or for no reason at all, which does happen rarely), disk space issues, etc.</p>

<p>You can find all kinds of complex scripts that do math on the various WAL positions that are available from the secondary and from pg<em>stat</em>replication on the primary.</p>

<p>Or you can do this. It&#8217;s very cheap and cheerful, and for many installations, it gets the job done.</p>

<p>First, on the primary (and thus on the secondary), we create a one-column table:</p>

<pre><code>CREATE TABLE replication_monitor (
   last_timestamp TIMESTAMPTZ
);
</code></pre>

<p>Then, we insert a singel row into the table (you can probably already see where this is going):</p>

<pre><code>INSERT INTO replication_monitor VALUES(now());
</code></pre>

<p>Having that, we can start a cron job that runs every minute, updating that value:</p>

<pre><code>* * * * * /usr/bin/psql -U postgres -c "update replication_monitor set last_update=now()" postgres &gt; /dev/null
</code></pre>

<p>On the secondary (which is kept in sync with the primary via NTP, so make sure ntpd is running on both!), we have a script, also run from cron, that complains if the value in has fallen more than a certain amount behind <code>now()</code>. Here&#8217;s a (pretty basic) Python 2 version:</p>

<pre><code>#!/usr/bin/python

import sys

import psycopg2

conn = psycopg2.connect("dbname=postgres user=postgres")

cur = conn.cursor()

cur.execute("select (now()-last_update)&gt;'5 minutes'::interval from replication_monitor")

problem = cur.fetchone()[0]

if problem:
    print &gt;&gt;sys.stderr, "cat1r replication lag over 5 minutes."
</code></pre>

<p>We make sure we get the output from <code>stderr</code> for cron jobs on the secondary, set it up to run every so often, and we&#8217;re done!</p>

<p>Of course, this has its limitations:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>It only has &#xb1;2 minutes of resolution, based on how often cron runs. For a basic &#8220;is replication working?&#8221; check, this is probably fine.</p></li>
<li><p>It creates traffic in the replication stream and WAL, but if you are really worried about a TIMESTAMPTZ&#8217;s worth of update once a minute, you probably have other things to worry about.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>It has the advantage that it works even if the server is otherwise not taking traffic, since it creates traffic all by itself.</p>

<p>As a final note, <a href="https://bucardo.org/wiki/Check_postgres">check_postgres</a> has this check integrated as one of the (many, many) checks it can do, as the <code>replicate_row</code> check. If you are using check_postgres, by all means use that one!</p>

            <h2>How to Implement Token Authentication with Django REST Framework</h2>
        </a>

        <p class="discreet">
            
                  By Chris Bartos from Django community aggregator: Community blog posts.
            
            
            
                Published on <span name="publication_time">Dec 27, 2016</span>.
            
        </p>

        <p>Token Authentication seems to be an Authentication Scheme that gives people the most trouble. The reason appears to be a misunderstanding not of so much how to implement it, but how to actually use it.</p>
<p>For example, the Django REST Framework documentation says that for every request, you have to add an <code>Authorization</code> Header to your requests. But, how do you create that <code>Authorization</code> header?</p>
<p>Also…</p>
<p>How do I use Token Authentication to authorize external clients? These are serious questions that I’ve seen from people just like you. But, the difference is that after reading this post, you’ll understand how that works. I’ll show you how to implement Token Authentication using Django REST Framework. Then, I’ll give you a sample application that uses Token Authentication to authenticate users <strong>within</strong> a Django Application. Best of all, you can take what you learn from my sample code to use in external clients (Javascript clients) to authenticate / authorize users with your RESTful API.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>WARNING</strong>: NEVER, EVER use Token Authentication without using Secure HTTP (HTTPS). If you want to run my sample code or play around with your own code locally it is <strong>OKAY</strong> to use Unsecure HTTP (HTTP). However, NEVER do it in production. You’ve been warned.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>Introduction to Token Authentication</h2>
<p>Token Authentication is a way to authorize users by using an <em>API Key</em> or <em>Auth Token</em>. The way Django REST Framework implements Token Authentication requires you to add a header for each request. This header will be in the following format:</p>
<pre><code>Authorization: Token 93138ba960dfb4ef2eef6b907718ae04400f606a
</code></pre>
<p><code>Authorization</code> is the header key and <code>Token 93138ba960dfb4ef2eef6b907718ae04400f606a</code> is the header value. Note, there is a space between <code>Token</code> and the token itself.</p>
<p>The server where your API lives will read off the user’s token and determine if there is a user assigned to that particular token.</p>
<p>This is Token Authentication in a nutshell. It really doesn’t get anymore complicated than that. The difficulty is implementing it for each of the clients that will use the API (Javascript apps, Desktop apps, Commandline, etc.)</p>
<h2>How to Implement Token Authentication</h2>
<p>The implementation is a bit more complicated than other Authentication Schemes so take this slow, digest each piece of the puzzle and make sure to download my sample code so you can see what I’m doing each step of the way.</p>
<h3>Preliminary Configuration</h3>
<p>As with all Django REST Framework Authentication schemes, you must configure the authentication scheme that you will use in your <code>settings.py</code> file.</p>
<p><em>myproject/settings.py</em></p>
<pre><code>REST_FRAMEWORK = { 
    'DEFAULT_AUTHENTICATION_CLASSES': (
        'rest_framework.authentication.TokenAuthentication',
    ),
    'DEFAULT_PERMISSION_CLASSES': (
        'rest_framework.permissions.IsAuthenticated',
    )
}
</code></pre>
<p>This is where it’s a little different than other Authentication schemes. You will also need to add an app to your <code>INSTALLED_APPS</code> array. The reason for this is because Token Authentication requires a special model called <code>Token</code> which is used to store your user authentication tokens.</p>
<p>In my sample application, my <code>INSTALLED_APPS</code> tuple looks like this:</p>
<p><em>myproject/settings.py</em></p>
<pre><code>INSTALLED_APPS = ( 
    'django.contrib.admin', 
    'django.contrib.auth', 
    'django.contrib.contenttypes', 
    'django.contrib.sessions', 
    'django.contrib.messages', 
    'django.contrib.staticfiles',
    'polls',
    'accounts',
    'rest_framework',
    'rest_framework.authtoken',
)
</code></pre>
<p>Now, in order to install the app and update the database with the new <code>Token</code> model, it is imperative that we run <code>python manage.py migrate</code>.</p>
<p>Now, you should be ready to create tokens for your users, create a <code>post_save</code> method on your <code>User</code> model so that whenever a new user is added to your database it will automatically create a token for them.</p>
<h3>Create Tokens for your Users</h3>
<p>Go to your project shell by typing this command at a terminal: <code>python manage.py shell</code>. You should be presented with a prompt that looks like this: <code>&gt;&gt;&gt;</code>.</p>
<p>Now, you’re going to type in the following code:</p>
<pre><code>from django.contrib.auth.models import User
from rest_framework.authtoken.models import Token

users = User.objects.all()
for user in users:
    token, created = Token.objects.get_or_create(user=user)
    print user.username, token.key
</code></pre>
<p>This code will retrieve all the users that currently exist in your database. It loops through each of them, generates a unique token for each of them and prints our their username and their token. It’s nice to print out their username and the token so you can see that it in fact worked correctly.</p>
<p>Now, you don’t want to manually create tokens for your users whenever a new user registers for your web app so you’ll have to create a special function that will automatically create a token for each new user:</p>
<p><em>myproject/accounts/models.py</em></p>
<pre><code>from django.conf import settings
from django.db.models.signals import post_save
from django.dispatch import receiver
from rest_framework.authtoken.models import Token 

@receiver(post_save, sender=settings.AUTH_USER_MODEL)
def create_auth_token(sender, instance=None, created=False, **kwargs):
    if created:
        Token.objects.create(user=instance)
</code></pre>
<p>Now, every time a new user is saved in your database, this function will run and a new Token will be created for that user.</p>
<h3>Create a Route for Retrieving a Token for Successfully logged in users</h3>
<p>Django REST Framework provides a view that simply returns the user’s token when they provide a correct username / password combo.</p>
<p>Let’s add this now:</p>
<p><em>myproject/accounts/urls.py</em></p>
<pre><code>from django.conf.urls import url
from django.conf import settings
from django.conf.urls.static import static

from . import views as local_view
from rest_framework.authtoken import views as rest_framework_views

urlpatterns = [ 
    # Session Login
    url(r'^login/$', local_views.get_auth_token, name='login'),
    url(r'^logout/$', local_views.logout_user, name='logout'),
    url(r'^auth/$', local_views.login_form, name='login_form'),
    url(r'^get_auth_token/$', rest_framework_views.obtain_auth_token, name='get_auth_token'),
] + static(settings.STATIC_URL, document_root=settings.STATIC_ROOT)
</code></pre>
<p>The bottom route is what you should notice:</p>
<pre><code>url(r'^get_auth_token/$', rest_framework_views.obtain_auth_token, name='get_auth_token'),
</code></pre>
<p>Now, when POST’ing to <code>http://localhost:8000/accounts/get_auth_token/</code> with the following data (assuming this username / password exists): <code>{ 'username': 'admin', 'password': 'admin' }</code> you’ll receive something that looks like the following: <code>{ 'token': '93138ba960dfb4ef2eef6b907718ae04400f606a' }</code></p>
<p>You’re done implementing Token Authentication. So, what can you do with this Authentication Scheme? Whatever you want. Let’s look at some sample code to see how this works.</p>

<li>Under “Headers” add the Header key: Content-Type. Make the Header value: application/json</li>
<li>Click “Send” and you should retrieve <code>"Authentication credentials were not provided."</code></li>
<li>Now, under “Headers” underneath “Content-Type” add the Header key: Authorization and add the Header value: “Token 93138ba960dfb4ef2eef6b907718ae04400f606a” (without the quotes).</li>
<li>Click “Send” again and you should be getting the correct data.</li>
</ol>
<h2>Homework (If you’d like…)</h2>
<ol>
<li>Look at <strong>ALL</strong> of my sample code.
<ul>
<li>Underneath the admin form in <code>login.html</code> there is some Javascript that creates a call to <code>http://localhost:8000/accounts/get_auth_token/</code> with my username and password. When I retrieve the token, I put it into a cookie called “token” and I redirect to the ‘/polls/‘ app.</li>
<li>In the <code>app.js</code> file (where my AngularJS code lives), [I created an “Interceptor”]. The purpose of it is to intercept requests and automatically add a Header with your token so that the Polls Application works correctly. If a request fails, it assumes the user isn’t authorized and redirects to the login form. </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Play around with Postman. As long as you keep the Authorization header you can run through the API endpoints and see what you get.</li>
<li>Play with [Python <em>Requests</em>]. Keep the Django Application running and see if you can write a program using Python Requests that will allow you to login and retrieve some information. </li>
</ol>
<p>The homework is to help you understand why you would want to use Token Authentication. You can create cool applications external to the Django Application that interface with your API. Give it a go and see what you come up with!</p>
<p>Until next time, Chris</p>

            <h2>3 Things You Need to Authenticate Users in Django</h2>
        </a>

        <p class="discreet">
            
                  By Chris Bartos from Django community aggregator: Community blog posts.
            
            
            
                Published on <span name="publication_time">Dec 27, 2016</span>.
            
        </p>

        <p>You want to authenticate users but you’re unsure how. The documentation isn’t the most helpful thing in the world. You think, “wow… this documentation assumes I know all this other stuff…”</p>
<p>What are the things you need to authenticate users? There are 3 things you need and I’m going to show you what each looks like.</p>
<h2>First: You need some routes</h2>
<p>You need authentication routes. I think it makes the most sense to create a separate app for this purpose. (Separate all your login logic from all your other logic)</p>
<p>Let’s look at some login routes:</p>
<p>_loginapp/urls.py</p>
<pre><code>from django.conf.urls import url
from django.conf import settings
from django.conf.urls.static import static

from . import views

urlpatterns = [
    # Session Login
    url(r'^login/$', views.login_user, name='login'),
    url(r'^logout/$', views.logout_user, name='logout'),
    url(r'^auth/$',  views.login_form, name='login_form'),
]
</code></pre>
<h2>Second: You’ll need some templates</h2>
<p>Templates are important. Templates are the HTML representation of your application. For example, at the bare minimum, you’ll need a way to let your users login. How do you do it? It doesn’t have to be pretty because this is <strong>JUST</strong> HTML.</p>
<p><em>loginapp/templates/loginapp/login.html</em></p>
<pre><code>&lt;form method='post' action="{%  url 'loginapp:login' %}"&gt;
    &lt;label for="username"&gt;Username:&lt;/label&gt;
    &lt;input type="text" name="username" /&gt;
    &lt;br&gt;
    &lt;label for="password"&gt;Password:&lt;/label&gt;
    &lt;input type="password" name="password" /&gt;
    &lt;br&gt;
    &lt;input type="submit" value="Login" /&gt;
&lt;/form&gt;
</code></pre>
<h2>Third: You’ll need some views</h2>
<p>The views you’ll need for login will be:<br />
1. The login form view (shows the login form)<br />
2. The POST view that will authenticate a user that is active / exists<br />
3. A view that will log the user out</p>
<p>Let’s start with the login form view (loginapp/auth):</p>
<pre><code>def login_form(request):
    return render(request, 'accounts/login.html', {})
</code></pre>
<p>This view simply renders our <code>login.html</code> template that we created above. It’s also possible to make only <strong>2</strong> routes (1 that will detect a POST request and 1 that will detect a GET request) however, I (personally) really like have separate views for each request method.</p>
<p>Here is an example of a view that will detect a username and password and use those credentials to authenticate a user and login the user thus creating a session specifically for that user.</p>
<pre><code>def login_user(request):
    username = request.POST.get('username')
    password = request.POST.get('password')
    user = authenticate(username=username, password=password)
    if user is not None:
        # the password verified for the user
        if user.is_active:
            login(request, user)
            return redirect('/polls/')
    return redirect(settings.LOGIN_URL, request)
</code></pre>
<p>This method will get the <code>username</code> and <code>password</code> from the POST request data. Then, we will use the <code>username</code> and <code>password</code> to try to authenticate a user that exists in our database.</p>
<p>If a user exists, we will try to login our user and redirect to our <code>polls</code> application. If the user does not exist we will redirect back to the login form.</p>
<p>How do you logout an authenticated user?</p>
<pre><code>def logout_user(request):
    logout(request)
    return redirect('/polls/')
</code></pre>
<p>This method will take the request object and user it to logout the logged in user. Once the user logs out, the application will redirect the user to our <code>polls</code> application.</p>
<p>This is the 3 things that you need to authenticate users in your Django application. (If you want to use Session Authentication with Django REST Framework) this is how you would accomplish this.</p>
<p>I hope that helps you when need to authenticate users in your future web application.</p>

Skip checkpoints, archiving on idle systems.

Some background activity (like checkpoints, archive timeout, standby
snapshots) is not supposed to happen on an idle system. Unfortunately
so far it was not easy to determine when a system is idle, which
defeated some of the attempts to avoid redundant activity on an idle
system.

To make that easier, allow to make individual WAL insertions as not
being "important". By checking whether any important activity happened
since the last time an activity was performed, it now is easy to check
whether some action needs to be repeated.

Use the new facility for checkpoints, archive timeout and standby
snapshots.

The lack of a facility causes some issues in older releases, but in my
opinion the consequences (superflous checkpoints / archived segments)
aren't grave enough to warrant backpatching.

<p>Postgres 9.0 has been the first release to introduce the parameter
<a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/devel/static/runtime-config-wal.html#runtime-config-wal-settings">wal_level</a>,
with three different values:</p>

<ul>
  <li>“minimal”, to get enough information WAL-logged to recover from a crash.</li>
  <li>“archive”, to be able to recover from a base backup and archives.</li>
  <li>“hot_standby”, to be able to have a standby node work, resulting in
  information about exclusive locks and currently running transactions
  to be WAL-logged, called standby snapshots.</li>
  <li>“logical”, introduced in 9.4, to work with logical decoding.</li>
</ul>

<p>In 9.6, “archive” and “hot_standby” have been merged into “replica” as
both levels have no difference in terms of performance. Another thing to
know is that standby snapshots are generated more often since 9.3 via the
bgwriter process, every 15 seconds to be exact.</p>

<p>So what is the commit above about? The fact that since “hot_standby” has
been introduced the logic that was present in xlog.c to decide if checkpoints
should be skipped or not was simply broken. As “hot_standby” has become a
standard in terms of configuration, many installations have been producing
useless checkpoints, or even useless WAL segments if archive_timeout was
being set. This is actually no big deal for most installations, as there
should always be some activity on a system, by that is meant activity that
produces new WAL records, hence a checkpoints or a WAL segment switch after
a timeout (if archive_timeout is set), would still have resulted in an
operation to happen.</p>

<p>The main issue here are embedded systems, where Postgres runs for ages
without intervention. For example an instance managing some internal
facility of a company very likely faces a downspike of activity on weekends,
because nobody is a robot and bodies need rest. Useless checkpoints being
generated actually can result in more WAL segments created. And while storing
those segments is not really a problem if they are compressed as the remaining
empty part is filled with zeros, installations that do not compress them
need some extra time to recover those segments in case of a crash, and that’s
even more painful for developments that have a spiky WAL activity.</p>

<p>This has resulted in a couple of bug reports and misunderstandings over
the last couple of years on the community mailing lists like
<a href="https://www.postgresql.org/message-id/20151016203031.3019.72930@wrigleys.postgresql.org">this thread</a>.</p>

<p>So in order to fix this problem has been designed a system allowing
to mark a WAL record as “important” or not regarding the activity it
creates. There has been much debate about the wording of this concept,
named at some point as well “progress”, debate going on for perhaps more
than a hundred of emails across many threads. There is also a set of
routines that can be used to fetch the last important WAL position that
can be used for more checks and do more fancy decision-making.</p>

<p>With this facility in place, records related to archive_timeout, understand
here WAL segment switch, and standby snapshots (WAL-logging of exclusive locks
and running transactions for hot standby nodes) are considered as
unimportant WAL activity to decide if a checkpoint should be executed or not.
Once those records are marked as such, deciding if a checkpoint should be
skipped or not is just a matter of comparing the WAL position of the last
checkpoint record with the last important WAL position. If they match, no
checkpoint need to happen. And then embedded systems are happy.</p>

        <p class="discreet">
            
                  By Chris Bartos from Django community aggregator: Community blog posts.
            
            
            
                Published on <span name="publication_time">Dec 23, 2016</span>.
            
        </p>

        <h2>Introduction to Session Authentication</h2>
<p>Session Authentication when used with Django REST Framework allows you to authenticate users very similar to the way Django authenticates users without Django REST Framework.</p>
<p>This will make it extremely easy to introduce a REST API to your web app without having to completely overhaul your authentication system.</p>
<p>The best part of this Authentication Scheme is you literally only have to change <strong>ONE</strong> line of your Django Application.</p>
<h2>Implementation Details (all the little bits…)</h2>
<p>In your <code>settings.py</code> file, just add <code>'rest_framework.authentication.SessionAuthentication',</code> to your <code>DEFAULT_AUTHENTICATION_CLASSES</code> setting.</p>
<p><em>myproject/settings.py</em></p>
<pre><code>REST_FRAMEWORK = {
    'DEFAULT_AUTHENTICATION_CLASSES': (
        'rest_framework.authentication.SessionAuthentication',
    ),
    'DEFAULT_PERMISSION_CLASSES': (
        'rest_framework.permissions.IsAuthenticated',
    )
}
</code></pre>
<p>Now, you will be able to login using the login form that you learned how to create when you took the <a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.10/intro/tutorial01/">Polls Django Tutorial</a>.</p>
<p>If you’d like an example of how this is accomplished, I’ve updated the Django Application I used to show you how to implement Basic Authentication using Django REST Framework. Now, it works using Session Authentication.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.chrisbartos.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/django_polls_session_auth.zip">Click Here to Download the Sample Code</a></p>
<h2>How to use this Sample Code</h2>
<ol>
<li>Unzip the code repository</li>
<li>Change directory to the unzipped code repository</li>
<li>Run the command <code>python manage.py runserver</code></li>
<li>Go to <a href="http://localhost:8000/polls/">http://localhost:8000/polls/</a> to run the code.</li>
<li>You’ll be redirected to a very crude login form</li>
<li>Type <code>admin</code> for the username and <code>admin</code> for the password</li>
<li>You’ll be redirected to the polls app and application should work.</li>
<li>Go to <a href="http://localhost:8000/accounts/logout">http://localhost:8000/accounts/logout</a> to logout of your session.</li>
<li>Go to <a href="http://localhost:8000/polls/api/questions/1">http://localhost:8000/polls/api/questions/1</a> to checkout the API (it should tell you that you’re not authenticated to look at the data).</li>
<li>Go to <a href="http://localhost:8000/accounts/login">http://localhost:8000/accounts/login</a> and login with <code>admin</code> for the username and <code>admin</code> for the password.</li>
<li>Go back to <a href="http://localhost:8000/polls/api/questions/1">http://localhost:8000/polls/api/questions/1</a> and you should be able to see the data now that you are signed in.</li>
</ol>
<p>That is the Session Authentication Scheme in a nutshell. I hope you realize how simple it is to implement. Now… for some homework!</p>
<h2>Homework (If you’d like…)</h2>
<ol>
<li>Use the sample application and change the static login form into an AJAX style form. (So, when you put in <code>admin</code> for the username and password and click <code>login</code> there should be an AJAX POST request with the username, password and CSRF Token that will attempt to login the user and either send a success message or a failure message. Then, redirect the user back to the <code>/polls/</code>. If you’re unsure how to add a CSRF Token to all AJAX requests, sign up for my FREE Django REST Framework email course below.)</li>

        <h2>Do you know what your options are?</h2>
<p>You learned a little bit of how authentication works with Django REST Framework from my short, FREE mini email course. What you might <strong>NOT</strong> know is that <em>Basic Authentication</em> isn’t the only type of authentication available do you.</p>
<p>You can use the following authentication schemes in Django REST framework and keep checking your inbox for implementation details for each of these authentication schemes.</p>
<h2>The list of Authentication types in Django REST Framework</h2>
<ol>
<li>Basic Authentication — you learned how to implement this while following my free email course. If you haven’t signed up for the email course yet, put your email address in the form at the end of this post.</li>
<li>Session Authentication — this is similar to the authentication that Django uses to authenticate users.</li>
<li>Token Authentication — Token Auth is how most APIs authenticate users. You might have played around some APIs that require an “API Key”. This is how you would implement that for <strong>your</strong> users.</li>
<li>Custom Authentication — If for some reason, the other authentication schemes don’t do what you want, you can override the BaseAuthentication class and create your own authentication scheme in Django REST Framework.</li>
<li>OAuth2 Authentication — OAuth authentication is a way to allow your users to authenticate using things like Social Media. I’m sure you’ve logged into certain web apps that allowed you to authenticate using Google or Facebook. This allows you to do that!</li>
</ol>
<h2>Which Authentication scheme is best for me?</h2>
<p>That will depend on your specific use case. If you know how to implement each of them, you’ll be better off in the long run. Come back to this post periodically. Each of the authentication schemes above will eventually link to a post that will show you <strong>EXACTLY</strong> how to implement each one.</p>

        <p>I spend a lot of time trying to learn what&#8217;s already been implemented, as DBA&#8217;s, we tend to live in that world.  It&#8217;s important that you have tools that allow you to quickly get the visual so you can get on with your job.  One of the biggest &#8216;reverse engineering&#8217; tasks that DBA&#8217;s have to do is in the area of data modeling.  There&#8217;s a lot of tools that do this, but my favorite of late is SchemaSpy (schemapy.sf.net).  I&#8217;ve found that the output is complete and the ERD&#8217;s are easy to read.</p>
<p><code>java -jar schemaSpy_5.0.0.jar -t pgsql -host localhost:5432 -db postgres \<br />
     -dp ~/software/pg/drivers/jdbc/postgresql-9.4.1208.jre6.jar \<br />
     -o ERD -u postgres -s myschema</code></p>
<p>SchemaSpy is nice because it can talk to many different types of databases&#8230; a side effect of this is a fairly complex set of commandline switches.</p>
<p>-t specifies the type, -t pgsql specifies postgres<br />
-o specifies a directory to create the output in</p>
<p>All you need in order to run this is the SchemaSpy jar and a postgresql jdbc driver.  In the output directory &#8216;ERD&#8217;.  Pulling up ERD/index.html gives you a nice page with a table list and some basics.</p>
<p><img alt="SchemaSpyDash" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-6784" height="272" src="http://wwwres.openscg.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/22221455/Screen-Shot-2016-12-22-at-5.02.24-PM-300x272.png" width="300" /></p>
<p>As a DBA, I really love the &#8216;Insertion Order&#8217; and &#8216;Deletion Order&#8217; links here.  SchemaSpy reverse engineers the referential integrity chain for me!  Clicking either one gives me a simple page, top to bottom with the right order!</p>
<p><img alt="InsertionOrder" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-6785" height="255" src="http://wwwres.openscg.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/22221457/Screen-Shot-2016-12-22-at-5.08.17-PM-300x255.png" width="300" /></p>
<p>Now for the real reason that I super-love SchemaSpy.  The &#8216;Relationships&#8217; tab.  I&#8217;ve loaded up a pgbench schema.  pgbench doesn&#8217;t actually create any real keys, but column names are consistent.  SchemaSpy notices this and &#8216;infers&#8217; relationships for me!  This is huge, even without explicity keys, I can begin to infer what the developer intended (the estimated rowcount is helpful too <img alt="🙂" class="wp-smiley" src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/2/72x72/1f642.png" style="height: 1em;" /></p>
<p><img alt="Relationships" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-6786" height="270" src="http://wwwres.openscg.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/22221500/Screen-Shot-2016-12-22-at-5.09.09-PM-300x270.png" width="300" /></p>
<p>I won&#8217;t force you to follow me through all of the tabs.  If you&#8217;re looking for a schema visualization tool, give SchemaSpy a try.</p>

        <p>Relational databases are the first choice of data store for many applications due to their enormous flexibility and reliability. Historically the one knock against relational databases is that they can only run on a single machine, which creates inherent limitations when data storage needs outpace server improvements. The solution to rapidly scaling databases is to distribute them, but this creates a performance problem of its own: relational operations such as joins then need to cross the network boundary. Co-location is the practice of dividing data tactically, where one keeps related information on the same machines to enable efficient relational operations, but takes advantage of the horizontal scalability for the whole dataset.</p>

<p>The principle of data co-location is that all tables in the database have a common distribution column and are sharded across machines in the same way such that rows with the same distribution column value are always on the same machine, even across different tables. As long as the distribution column provides a meaningful grouping of data, relational operations can be performed within the groups. </p>

<p>In a <a href="https://www.citusdata.com/blog/2016/10/03/designing-your-saas-database-for-high-scalability/">previous article</a> we described how to shard a multi-tenant application with co-location as the underlying technique. In this article, we zoom into how data co-location works in Citus and the benefits it provides.</p>

<h3>Data co-location in Citus for hash-distributed tables</h3>

<p>The Citus extension for PostgreSQL is unique in being able to form a distributed database of databases. Every node in a Citus cluster is a fully functional PostgreSQL database and Citus adds the experience of a single homogenous database on top. While it does not provide the full functionality of PostgreSQL in a distributed way, in many cases it can take full advantage of features offered by PostgreSQL on a single machine through co-location, including full SQL support, transactions and foreign keys. </p>

<p>In Citus a row is stored in a shard if the hash of the value in the distribution column falls within the shard’s hash range. To ensure co-location, shards with the same hash range are always placed on the same node even after rebalance operations, such that equal distribution column values are always on the same node across tables.</p>

<p><img alt="hash ranges" src="https://d3vv6lp55qjaqc.cloudfront.net/items/0P422j29173t2r0t2F22/hash-ranges.png?X-CloudApp-Visitor-Id=e4475d145dcf11ebcffabf840edcc11f&amp;v=a62a5b08" /></p>

<p>A distribution column that we’ve found to work well in practice is tenant ID in <a href="https://www.citusdata.com/blog/2016/08/10/sharding-for-a-multi-tenant-app-with-postgres/">multi-tenant applications</a>. For example, SaaS applications typically have many tenants, but every query they make is specific to a particular tenant. While providing a database or schema for every tenant is one option, it is often <a href="https://influitive.io/our-multi-tenancy-journey-with-postgres-schemas-and-apartment-6ecda151a21f">costly and impractical</a> as there can be many operations that span across users (data loading, migrations, aggregations, analytics, schema changes, backups, etc.) that becomes harder to manage as the number of tenants grows.</p>

<h3>A practical example of co-location</h3>

<p>Consider the following tables, that might be part of a multi-tenant web analytics SaaS:</p>
<pre class="highlight sql"><code><span class="k">CREATE</span> <span class="k">TABLE</span> <span class="n">event</span> <span class="p">(</span>
    <span class="n">event_id</span> <span class="n">bigint</span><span class="p">,</span>
    <span class="n">tenant_id</span> <span class="n">int</span><span class="p">,</span>
    <span class="n">page_id</span> <span class="n">int</span><span class="p">,</span>
    <span class="n">payload</span> <span class="n">jsonb</span><span class="p">,</span> 
    <span class="k">primary</span> <span class="k">key</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="n">tenant_id</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">event_id</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="p">);</span>

<span class="k">CREATE</span> <span class="k">TABLE</span> <span class="n">page</span> <span class="p">(</span>
    <span class="n">page_id</span> <span class="n">int</span><span class="p">,</span>
    <span class="n">tenant_id</span> <span class="n">int</span><span class="p">,</span>
    <span class="n">path</span> <span class="n">text</span><span class="p">,</span> 
    <span class="k">primary</span> <span class="k">key</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="n">tenant_id</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">page_id</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="p">);</span>
</code></pre>
<p>Now we want to answer queries that may be issued by a customer-facing dashboard, such as:</p>

<p>“Return the number of visits in the past week for all pages starting with ‘/blog’ for tenant 6”</p>

<h3>Using Regular PostgreSQL Tables</h3>

<p>If our data was in a single PostgreSQL node, we could easily express our query using the rich set of relational operations offered by SQL:</p>
<pre class="highlight sql"><code><span class="k">SELECT</span> <span class="n">page_id</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="k">count</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">event_id</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="k">FROM</span>
  <span class="n">page</span> 
<span class="k">LEFT</span> <span class="k">JOIN</span>  <span class="p">(</span>
  <span class="k">SELECT</span> <span class="o">*</span> <span class="k">FROM</span> <span class="n">event</span>
  <span class="k">WHERE</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="n">payload</span><span class="o">-&gt;&gt;</span><span class="s1">'time'</span><span class="p">)::</span><span class="n">timestamptz</span> <span class="o">&gt;=</span> <span class="n">now</span><span class="p">()</span> <span class="o">-</span> <span class="n">interval</span> <span class="s1">'1 week'</span>
<span class="p">)</span> <span class="n">recent</span> 
<span class="k">USING</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="n">tenant_id</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">page_id</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="k">WHERE</span> <span class="n">tenant_id</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="mi">6</span> <span class="k">AND</span> <span class="n">path</span> <span class="k">LIKE</span> <span class="s1">'/blog%'</span>
<span class="k">GROUP</span> <span class="k">BY</span> <span class="n">page_id</span><span class="p">;</span>
</code></pre>
<p>As long the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Working_set">working set</a> for this query fits in memory, this is an appropriate solution for many application since it offers maximum flexibility. However, even if you don’t need to scale yet, it can be useful to consider the implications of scaling out on your data model.</p>

<h3>Distributing tables by ID</h3>

<p>As the number of tenants and the data stored for each tenant grows, query times will typically go up as the working set no longer fits in memory or CPU becomes a bottleneck. In this case, we can shard the data across many nodes using Citus. The first and most important choice we need to make when sharding is the distribution column. Let’s start with a naive choice of using <code>event_id</code> for the <code>event</code> table and <code>page_id</code> for the <code>page</code> table:</p>
<pre class="highlight sql"><code><span class="c1">-- create Citus tables, naively use event_id and page_id as distribution columns</span>
<span class="k">SELECT</span> <span class="n">create_distributed_table</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s1">'event'</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s1">'event_id'</span><span class="p">);</span>
<span class="k">SELECT</span> <span class="n">create_distributed_table</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s1">'page'</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s1">'page_id'</span><span class="p">);</span>
</code></pre>
<p>Given that the data is dispersed across different workers, we cannot simply perform a join as we would on a single PostgreSQL node. Instead, we will need to answer this query in two steps:</p>

<p>Across all shards of the page table (Q1):</p>
<pre class="highlight sql"><code><span class="k">SELECT</span> <span class="n">page_id</span> <span class="k">FROM</span> <span class="n">page</span> <span class="k">WHERE</span> <span class="n">path</span> <span class="k">LIKE</span> <span class="s1">'/blog%'</span> <span class="k">AND</span> <span class="n">tenant_id</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="mi">6</span><span class="p">;</span>
</code></pre>
<p>Across all shards of the event table (Q2):</p>
<pre class="highlight sql"><code><span class="k">SELECT</span> <span class="n">page_id</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="k">count</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="o">*</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="k">AS</span> <span class="k">count</span>
<span class="k">FROM</span> <span class="n">events</span>
<span class="k">WHERE</span> <span class="n">page_id</span> <span class="k">IN</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="n">ARRAY</span><span class="p">[...</span><span class="n">page</span> <span class="n">IDs</span> <span class="k">from</span> <span class="k">first</span> <span class="n">query</span><span class="p">...])</span> <span class="k">AND</span> 
      <span class="n">tenant_id</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="mi">6</span> <span class="k">AND</span> 
      <span class="n">payload</span><span class="o">-&gt;&gt;</span><span class="s1">'time'</span> <span class="o">&gt;=</span> <span class="n">now</span><span class="p">()</span> <span class="o">-</span> <span class="n">interval</span> <span class="s1">'1 week'</span>
<span class="k">GROUP</span> <span class="k">BY</span> <span class="n">page_id</span> <span class="k">ORDER</span> <span class="k">BY</span> <span class="k">count</span> <span class="k">DESC</span> <span class="k">LIMIT</span> <span class="mi">10</span><span class="p">;</span>
</code></pre>
<p>Afterwards, the results from the two steps need to be combined by the application.</p>

<p>The data required to answer the query is scattered across the shards on the different nodes and each of those shards will need to be queried:</p>

<p><img alt="without-colocation" src="https://d3vv6lp55qjaqc.cloudfront.net/items/0u0N291S032U3U0S1Q1v/without-colocation.png?X-CloudApp-Visitor-Id=e4475d145dcf11ebcffabf840edcc11f&amp;v=96e3c57f" /></p>

<p>In this case, the data distribution creates substantial drawbacks:</p>

<p>Overhead from querying each shard, running multiple queries
Overhead of Q1 returning many rows to the client, also causes Q2 to be very large
Need to write queries in multiple steps, combine results, requires changes in the application</p>

<p>A potential upside of the relevant data being dispersed is that the queries can be parallelised, which Citus will do. However, this is only beneficial if the amount of work that the query does is substantially greater than the overhead of querying many shards. It’s generally better to avoid doing such heavy lifting directly from the application, for example by <a href="https://www.citusdata.com/blog/2016/11/29/event-aggregation-at-scale-with-postgresql/">pre-aggregating the data</a>.</p>

<h3>Distributing tables by tenant</h3>

<p>Looking at our query again, we can see that all the rows that the query needs have one dimension in common: <code>tenant_id</code>. The dashboard will only ever query for a tenant’s own data. That means that if data for the same tenant are always co-located on a single PostgreSQL node, our original query could be answered in a single step by that node by performing a join on <code>tenant_id</code> and <code>page_id</code>.</p>

<p>In Citus, rows with the same distribution column value are guaranteed to be on the same node. Each shard in a distributed table effectively has a set of co-located shards from other distributed tables that contain the same distribution column values (data for the same tenant). Starting over, we can create our tables with <code>tenant_id</code> as the distribution column.</p>
<pre class="highlight sql"><code><span class="c1">-- create Citus tables, co-locate them by using a common distribution column</span>
<span class="k">SELECT</span> <span class="n">create_distributed_table</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s1">'event'</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s1">'tenant_id'</span><span class="p">);</span>
<span class="k">SELECT</span> <span class="n">create_distributed_table</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s1">'page'</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s1">'tenant_id'</span><span class="p">);</span>
</code></pre>
<p>In this case, Citus can answer the same query that you would run on a single PostgreSQL node without modification (Q1):</p>
<pre class="highlight sql"><code><span class="k">SELECT</span> <span class="n">page_id</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="k">count</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">event_id</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="k">FROM</span>
  <span class="n">page</span> 
<span class="k">LEFT</span> <span class="k">JOIN</span>  <span class="p">(</span>
  <span class="k">SELECT</span> <span class="o">*</span> <span class="k">FROM</span> <span class="n">event</span>
  <span class="k">WHERE</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="n">payload</span><span class="o">-&gt;&gt;</span><span class="s1">'time'</span><span class="p">)::</span><span class="n">timestamptz</span> <span class="o">&gt;=</span> <span class="n">now</span><span class="p">()</span> <span class="o">-</span> <span class="n">interval</span> <span class="s1">'1 week'</span>
<span class="p">)</span> <span class="n">recent</span> 
<span class="k">USING</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="n">tenant_id</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">page_id</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="k">WHERE</span> <span class="n">tenant_id</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="mi">6</span> <span class="k">AND</span> <span class="n">path</span> <span class="k">LIKE</span> <span class="s1">'/blog%'</span>
<span class="k">GROUP</span> <span class="k">BY</span> <span class="n">page_id</span><span class="p">;</span>
</code></pre>
<p>Because of the tenant<em>id filter and join on tenant</em>id, Citus knows that the entire query can be answered using the set of co-located shards that contain the data for that particular tenant, and the PostgreSQL node can answer the query in a single step, which enables full SQL support.</p>

<p><img alt="with colocation" src="https://d3vv6lp55qjaqc.cloudfront.net/items/2a2B3s2x021n203I1g22/with-colocation.png?X-CloudApp-Visitor-Id=e4475d145dcf11ebcffabf840edcc11f&amp;v=bc3e5081" /></p>

<p>In some cases, queries and table schemas will require minor modifications to ensure that the tenant_id is always included in unique constraints and join conditions. However, this is usually a straightforward change, and the extensive rewrite that would be required without having co-location is avoided.</p>

<p>While the example above queries just one node because there is a specific <code>tenant_id = 6</code> filter, co-location also allows us to efficiently perform distributed joins on <code>tenant_id</code> across all nodes, be it with SQL limitations.</p>

<h3>Co-location means better feature support</h3>

<p>The full list of Citus features that are unlocked by co-location are:</p>

<ul>
<li>Full SQL support for queries on a single set of co-located shards</li>
<li>Multi-statement transaction support for modifications on a single set of co-located shards</li>
<li><a href="https://www.citusdata.com/blog/2016/11/29/event-aggregation-at-scale-with-postgresql/">Aggregation through INSERT..SELECT</a></li>
<li>Foreign keys</li>
<li>Distributed <a href="https://www.citusdata.com/blog/2016/10/10/outer-joins-in-citus/">outer joins</a></li>
</ul>

<p>This list is likely to grow further in the future, as we leverage the underlying PostgreSQL databases for co-located data.</p>

<p>Data co-location is a powerful technique for providing both horizontal scale and supporting relational data models. The cost of migrating or building applications using a distributed database that enables relational operations through co-location is often substantially lower than moving to a restrictive data model (e.g. NoSQL) and unlike a single-node database it can scale out with the size of your business.</p>

<p>Citus allows you to automatically shard and co-locate your data, providing horizontal scale while taking advantage of PostgreSQL’s rich feature set. If you would like to give Citus a try, you can set up a fully managed cluster in minutes using <a href="https://www.citusdata.com/product/cloud">Citus Cloud</a>.</p>

        We're happy to announce that Aiven PostgreSQL now has support for connection pools. Connection pooling allow you to maintain very large numbers of connections to a database while keeping the server resource usage low.<br /><br />Aiven PostgreSQL connection pooling utilizes PGBouncer for managing the database connection and each pool can handle up to <b>5000 database client connections</b>. Unlike when connecting directly to the PostgreSQL server, each client connection does not require a separate backend process on the server. PGBouncer automatically interleaves the client queries and only uses a limited number of actual backend connections, leading to lower resource usage on the server and better total performance.<br /><br /><h3>Why connection pooling? </h3><br />Eventually a high number of backend connections becomes a problem with PostgreSQL as the resource cost per connection is quite high due to the way PostgreSQL manages client connections. PostgreSQL creates a separate backend process for each connection and the unnecessary memory usage caused by the processes will start hurting the total throughput of the system at some point. Also, if each connection is very active, the performance can be affected by the high number of parallel executing tasks.<br /><br />It makes sense to have enough connections so that each CPU core on the server has something to do (each connection can only utilize a single CPU core [1]), but a hundred connections per CPU core may be too much. All this is workload specific, but often a good number of connections to have is in the ballpark of 3-5 times the CPU core count.<br /><br />[1] PostgreSQL 9.6 introduced limited parallelization support for <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.6/static/parallel-query.html" target="_blank">running queries in parallel</a> on multiple CPU cores.<br /><br />Without a connection pooler the database connections are handled directly by PostgreSQL backend processes, one process per connection:<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-iPGVAZNT7B0/WFpXPtuJnUI/AAAAAAAAAHk/tdzJOWS8Zr4cpCSrz-1DmoKrazOokpiBQCLcB/s1600/pgbouncer-pooling-none.png" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="278" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-iPGVAZNT7B0/WFpXPtuJnUI/AAAAAAAAAHk/tdzJOWS8Zr4cpCSrz-1DmoKrazOokpiBQCLcB/s640/pgbouncer-pooling-none.png" width="640" /></a></div><br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><br /></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><br /></div>Adding a PGBouncer pooler that utilizes fewer backend connections frees up server resources for more important uses, such as disk caching:<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-rnuJi_Ns2Iw/WFpXPrlar-I/AAAAAAAAAHo/hADVd8XKe_ssDYzxvdQFgtwKk87Rauk6ACEw/s1600/pgbouncer-pooling-enabled.png" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="278" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-rnuJi_Ns2Iw/WFpXPrlar-I/AAAAAAAAAHo/hADVd8XKe_ssDYzxvdQFgtwKk87Rauk6ACEw/s640/pgbouncer-pooling-enabled.png" width="640" /></a></div><br /><br /><br />Many frameworks and libraries (ORMs, Django, Rails, etc.) support client-side pooling, which solves much the same problem. However, when there are many distributed applications or devices accessing the same database, a client-side solution is not enough.<br /><br /><h3>Connection pooling modes</h3><br />Aiven PostgreSQL supports three different operational pool modes: "session", "transaction" and "statement".<br /><br /><ul><li>The <b>"session"</b> pooling mode means that once a client connection is granted access to a PostgreSQL server-side connection, it can hold it until the client disconnects from the pooler. After this the server connection will be returned back into the connection pooler's free connection list to wait for its next client connection. Client connections will be accepted (at TCP level), but their queries will only proceed once another client disconnects and frees up its backend connection back into the pool. This mode can be helpful in some cases for providing a wait queue for incoming connections while keeping the server memory usage low, but has limited usefulness under most common scenarios due to the slow recycling of the backend connections.</li><li>The <b>"transaction"</b> pooling mode on the other hand allows each client connection to take their turn in using a backend connection for the duration of a single transaction. After the transaction is committed, the backend connection is returned back into the pool and the next waiting client connection gets to reuse the same connection immediately. In practise this provides quick response times for queries as long as the typical transaction execution times are not excessively long. This is the most commonly used PGBouncer mode and also the Aiven PostgreSQL default pooling mode.</li><li>The third operational pooling mode is <b>"statement"</b> and it is similar to the "transaction" pool mode, except that instead of allowing a full transaction to be run, it cycles the server side connections after each and every database statement (<span>SELECT,</span> <span>INSERT</span>, <span>UPDATE</span>, <span>DELETE</span> statements, etc.) Transactions containing multiple SQL statements are not allowed in this mode. This mode is sometimes used for example when running specialized sharding front-end proxies.</li></ul><br /><h3>How to get started with Aiven PostgreSQL connection pooling</h3><br />First you need an Aiven PostgreSQL service, for the purposes of this tutorial we assume you already have created one.

Now let's check how many connections there are to the PostgreSQL backend&nbsp; database:<br /><br />Terminal #1:<br /><br /><span>mypool=&gt; SELECT COUNT(*) FROM pg_stat_activity WHERE usename = 'avnadmin';</span><br /><span>&nbsp;count </span><br /><span>-------</span><br /><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1</span><br /><span>(1 row)</span><br /><br />And as we can see from the pg_stat_activity output the two <span>psql</span> sessions use the same PostgreSQL server database connection.<br /><br /><h3>Summary</h3><br />The more client connections you have to your database, the more useful connection pooling becomes. Aiven PostgreSQL makes using connection pooling an easy task and migrating from non-pooled connections to pooled connections is just a matter of gradually changing your client-side connection database name and port number!<br /><br /><h3><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://aiven.io/" style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;" target="_blank"><img border="0" src="https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-Y6Sn7O004-0/VtRGMsEi_9I/AAAAAAAAAC0/FtwEvCS-5KU4wNhLCt1cRPMsb4CuwqZSwCPcB/s1600/tryfree-tag.png" /></a></div>Try PostgreSQL 9.6 for free in Aiven</h3><br />Remember that trying Aiven is free: you will receive US$10 worth of free   credits at sign-up which you can use to try any of our service plans.

<p>It was my pleasure to contribute to the community by sharing my professional experience. I gave a talk about PostgreSQL on Network File System, a research based on crash tests to prove reliability using PostgreSQL on NFS. Sharing my PostgreSQL experience with the participants was useful and pleasant.</p>
<p>During the event, I had the chance to attend the talk about tools for upgrading Postgres between major releases given by Denis Gasparin; and the one about ULSS&#8217;s (Regional Healthcare System) migration to Open Source, given by Giorgio Roncolato, proving that more institutions than we thought are ready to embrace this philosophy.</p>
<p>I can&#8217;t forget to mention the animated talks of Mladen Marinovic, in which he was able to warn us about the importance of testing and code review, in a fun way.</p>
<p>These kinds of events are valuable moments for sharing knowledge, thanks to the discussions that start after talks, and during social networking moments.</p>
<p>PGDay gave me the opportunity to make new friendships and strengthen the old ones. The day ended with an aperitivo that allowed people to exchange opinions, and extended the stay of some participants.</p>

                Published on <span name="publication_time">Dec 18, 2016</span>.
            
        </p>

        <p>Stripe is starting to <a href="https://stripe.com/jobs/positions/infrastructure-engineer">build out a load generation team in Seattle</a> (that&rsquo;s a posting for San Francisco,
but also works for Seattle), and consequently I&rsquo;ve
been thinking more about load generation lately. In particular, I&rsquo;ve been thinking that I know
a lot less about the topic than I&rsquo;d like to, so here is a collection of sources and reading notes.</p>

<p>Hopefully, I&rsquo;ll  synthesize these into something readable soon!</p>

<h3>The Interesting Questions</h3>

<p>Perhaps because many companies never develop a mature solution for load generation,
and because none of the open source solutions command broad awareness (except maybe JMeter?),
it tends to be a place with far more opinions than average, and consequently there
are quite a few interesting questions to think through.</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s start by exploring a few of those.</p>

<ol>
<li><p><strong>Should you be load testing?</strong> Surprisingly few companies invest much into load testing,
so it&rsquo;s never entirely clear if you <em>should</em> be investing at a given point in time.
My anecdotal impression is that companies which &ldquo;believe in QA&rdquo; tend to invest into load
testing early, because they have dedicated people who can build the tooling and integration,
and that most other companies tend to ignore it until they&rsquo;re doing a significant amount of
unplanned scalability investment. Said differently, for most companies
load testing is a mechanism to convert unplanned scalability work into planned scalability work.</p></li>

<li><p><strong>Should you be load testing, redux?</strong> Beyond whether you should invest into building load testing tooling,
<a href="https://twitter.com/davinbogan">my colleague Davin</a> suggested an interesting perspective
that most of the metrics generated by load testing can also be obtained through thoughtful
instrumentation and analysis of your existing traffic.</p></li>

<li><p><strong>What layer of your infrastructure should you load test against?</strong>
Depending on the application you&rsquo;re running, it may be easy to generate load against your external interfaces (website, API, etc)
but as you go deeper into your infrastructure you may want to run load
against a specific service or your stateful systems (Kafka, databases, etc).</p></li>

<li><p><strong>What environment should you run your tests against?</strong> Perhaps the most common argument when
rolling out load testing is whether you should run it against an existing QA environment,
against a dedicated performance environment, or against your production environment.
This depends a great deal on the layer you&rsquo;re testing at, and if you&rsquo;re doing load
(how does the system react to this traffic?) or stress (at what load does the system fail?)
testing.</p></li>

<li><p><strong>How should you model your traffic?</strong> Starting with the dead simple <a href="https://github.com/JoeDog/siege">Siege</a>,
there are quite a few different ways to think about generating your load.
Should you send a few request patterns at a high concurrency? Should you model your traffic using
a state machine (codified in a simple script, or perhaps in a DSL), or should you just replay
sanitized production traffic?</p></li>

<li><p><strong>Is the distinction between integration testing and load testing just a matter of scale?</strong>
As you start thinking about it, integration testing is running requests against a server and
ensuring the results are reasonable, and that&rsquo;s pretty much the exact same thing as
load testing. It&rsquo;s pretty tempting to try to solve both problems with one tool.</p></li>

<li><p><strong>How should you configure load tests? Where should that configuration live?</strong>
Merging into the whole &ldquo;is configuration code?&rdquo; debate, where should the configuration
for your load tests live? Ideally it would be in your service&rsquo;s repository, right?
Or perhaps it should be stored in a dynamic configuration database somewhere to
allow more organic exploration and testing? Hmm.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Alright then, with those questions in mind, time to read some papers.</p>

<p>As part of my research, I ran into <a href="http://barbie.uta.edu/~jxu/Stress%20testing.htm">an excellent list of stress and load testing papers</a>
from the Software Engineering Research Group at University of Texas Arlington. Many of these
papers are pulled from there, and it&rsquo;s a great starting point for your reading as well!</p>

<h3><a href="http://barbie.uta.edu/~jxu/A%20Methodology%20to%20Support%20Load%20Test%20Analysis.pdf">A Methodology to Support Load Test Analytics</a></h3>

<p><a href="http://barbie.uta.edu/~jxu/A%20Methodology%20to%20Support%20Load%20Test%20Analysis.pdf">A Methodology to Support Load Test Analytics</a> (2010) starts with an excellent
thought on why load testing is becoming increasingly important and complex:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>For [ultra large scale systems], it is impossible for an analyst to skim
through the huge volume of performance counters to find the
required information. Instead, analyst employ few key
performance counters known to [her] from past practice,
performance gurus and domain trends as &lsquo;rules of thumb&rsquo;. In a
ULSS, there is no single person with complete knowledge of end
to end geographically distributed system activities.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That rings true to my experience.</p>

<p>With increasingly complex systems,
it is remarkably hard to actually find the performance choke points,
and load testing aspires to offer the distributed
systems equivalent of a profiler. (This is also why QA environments
are fraught with failures: as systems become increasingly complex, creating a useful
facimile becomes rather hard.)</p>

<p>A few other interesting ideas:</p>

<ol>
<li>Fairly naive software can batch together highly correlated metrics, to greatly reduce
the search space for humans to understand where things are degrading.</li>
<li>Most test designs mean they can only run occasionally (as opposed to continuously), and interfering workloads
(e.g. a weekly batch job occuring during your load test)
can easily invalidate the data of those infrequent runs.</li>
<li>Many tests end up with artificial constraints when run against non-production environments
like QA, for example running against underpowered or mis-configured databases.</li>
<li>They use &ldquo;Principal Component Analysis&rdquo; to find the minimal principal components
which are <em>not</em> correlated with each other, so you have less redundant data to explore.</li>
<li>After they&rsquo;ve found the key Principal Components, they then convert those back into the underlying
counters, which are human comprehensible, for further analysis.</li>
<li>Ideally, you should be able to use historical data to build load signatures, such that you
could quickly determine if the system&rsquo;s fundamental constraint has shifted (e.g. you&rsquo;ve
finally fixed your core bottleneck and got a new one, or something else has degraded such
that it is not your core bottleneck).</li>
</ol>

<p>In particular, my take away is that probably the right load generation tool
will start with a fairly simple approach with manually identified key metrics, and then
move increasingly to using machine learning to avoid our implicit biases around where our
systems <em>ought</em> to be slow.</p>

<h3><a href="http://du.diva-portal.org/smash/get/diva2:518118/FULLTEXT01">A Unified Load Generator For Geographically&hellip;</a></h3>

<p><a href="http://du.diva-portal.org/smash/get/diva2:518118/FULLTEXT01">A Unified Load Generator for Geographically Distributed Generation of Network Traffic</a> (2006)
is a master&rsquo;s thesis, that happens to be an pretty excellent survey of
academic ideas and topics around load generation.</p>

<p>One of the interesting ideas here is:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>to design an accurate artificial load generator which is responsible to act in a flexible
manner under different situations we need not only a load model but also a formal method to specify
the realistic load.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I&rsquo;m not sure I entirely agree that we need a formal model to get value from our load testing,
we are after all trying to convert unplanned scalability work into planned scalability work,
but I have such an industry focus that it&rsquo;s a fascinating idea to me that you would even try to
create a formal model here.</p>

<p>It also introduces a more specific vocabulary for discussing load generation:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The workload or load L=L (E, S, IF, T) denotes the total sequence of requests which
is offered by an environment E to a service system S via a well-defined interface IF during the timeinterval
T.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Perhaps more interestingly, is the emphasize on how <a href="http://lethain.com/qos-cost-quotas/">quality of service</a>
forces us to redefine the goal of load testing:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The need for telecommunication networks capable of providing communication services such as
data, voice and video motivated to deliver an acceptable QoS level to the users, and their success
depends on the development of effective congestion control schemes.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I find this a fascinating point. As your systems start to include more systematic load shedding mechanisms,
it becomes increasingly challenging to push them out of equilibrium because they (typically) preserve
<a href="http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.24.3690&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf">harvest by degrading yield</a>.
It&rsquo;s consequently not enough to say that your systems should or should not fail at a given level of load,
you also have to start to measure if it degrades appropriately based on load levels.</p>

<p>In section 3.5, it explains (the seemingly well known, albeit not to me) UniLog, also known as the Unified Load Generator.
(Which is perhaps based on <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/220769797_A_unified_load_generator_based_on_formal_load_specification_and_load_transformation">this paper</a>,
which is sadly hidden behind a paywall.) UniLog has an interesting architecture with intimidatingly
exciting component names like PLM, ELM, GAR, LT, ADAPT and EEM. As best I can tell it is an extremely
generic architecture for running and evaluating load experiments. It feels slightly overdesigned
from my first reading, but perhaps as one spends more time in the caverns of load generation it
starts to make more sense.</p>

<p>In section 4.4, it discusses centralized versus distributed load generation, which feels like
one of the core design decisions you need to make for building such a system. My sense is that
you likely want a distributed approach at some point, if only to avoid getting completely throttled
by QoS operating on a per-IP ratelimit.</p>

<p>The rest of the paper focuses on some case studies and such. Overall, it was a surprisingly thorough
introduction to the related research.</p>

<h3><a href="http://barbie.uta.edu/~jxu/Automated%20analysis%20of%20load%20testing%20results.pdf">Automated Analysis of Load Testing Results</a></h3>

<p><a href="http://barbie.uta.edu/~jxu/Automated%20analysis%20of%20load%20testing%20results.pdf">Automated Analysis of Load Testing Results</a> takes a look at using automation to understand
load test results (using both the execution logs of the load test and overall system metrics during
the load test).</p>

<p>It summarizes the challenges of analyzing load test results as: outdated documentation,
process-level profiling is cost prohibitive, load testing typically occurs late in the development
cycle with short time lines, and the output from load tests can be overwhelmingly large.</p>

<p>I think the most interesting take away for me is the idea of very explicitly decoupling the gathering
of performance data from its analysis. For example, you could start logging performance data early on
(and likely your metrics tool, e.g. Graphite, already is capturing that data), and invest into more
sophisticated analysis much later on. There is particular focus on comparing results across multiple
load test runs, which can at a minimum narrow in on where performance &ldquo;lives&rdquo; within your metrics.</p>

<h3>Even more papers&hellip;</h3>

<p>Some additional papers with short summaries:</p>

<p><a href="http://barbie.uta.edu/~jxu/Converting%20users%20to%20testers%20an%20alternative%20approach%20to%20load%20test%20script%20creation,%20parameterization%20and%20data%20corellation.pdf">Converting Users to Testers</a> - This paper discusses recording user traffic as an input to your load testing, with the goal of reducing time spent writing load generation scripts.</p>

<p><a href="http://barbie.uta.edu/~jxu/automatic%20feedback,%20contro-based%20stress%20and%20load%20testing.pdf">Automatic Feedback, Control-Based, Stress and Load Testing</a> - This paper
explores the idea of systems that try to drive and maintain load on a system to targeted threshold. This is an interesting idea
because this would allow you to consistently run load against your production environment. The only caveat is that you have
to first identify the inputs you want to use to influence that load, so you still need to model the incoming traffic in
order to use it as an input (or record and sanitize real traffic), but at least once you have modeled it you could be more
abstract in how you use that model (if your target is to create load, you don&rsquo;t necessarily need to simulate realistic
traffic, and you could use something like an n-armed bandit approach to &ldquo;optimize&rdquo; your load to generate the correct amount
of load against the system). (Similarly, <a href="http://barbie.uta.edu/~jxu/stress%20testing%20real-time%20systems%20with%20genetic%20algorithms.pdf">this paper tries to do that using genetic algorithms</a>.)</p>

<h3>Existing Tools</h3>

<p>There are surprisingly few load testing tools, although <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Load_testing#Software_load_testing">wikipedia has a short list</a>.
Of that list, I&rsquo;ve actually used <a href="http://jmeter.apache.org/">JMeter</a> some years ago, and I enjoyed
<a href="http://www.fredberinger.com/2010/05/why-is-hp-killing-loadrunner/">this short rant about HP&rsquo;s Loadrunner tooling</a>.</p>

<p>I took a brief look at <a href="http://gatling.io/">Gatling</a>, which is a lightweight DSL written in Scala,
which can be easily run by Jenkins or such. This seems like an interesting potential starting point
for building a load generation tool. In particular the concept of treating your load tests as something
you would check into your repository feels right, allowing you to iterate on your load tests like you
would anything else.
Reading through <a href="https://www.thoughtworks.com/insights/blog/gatling-take-your-performance-tests-next-level">a few</a>
other
<a href="http://callistaenterprise.se/blogg/teknik/2014/04/16/a-first-look-at-gatling-a-dsl-based-load-test-tool/">blog posts</a>
on Gatling gave me a stronger sense that this might be a useful component of an overall load testing system
(that allowed, e.g. many instances to be run against different endpoints or such).</p>

<p>Are there others that I&rsquo;m missing out on?</p>

<h3><a href="http://drops.dagstuhl.de/opus/volltexte/2011/2957/pdf/5.pdf">Web Workload Generation According to&hellip;</a></h3>

<p>As the name suggests, <a href="http://drops.dagstuhl.de/opus/volltexte/2011/2957/pdf/5.pdf">Web Workload Generation According to UniLoG Approach</a>
looks at adapting the UniLoG approach to the web. It nicely summarizes UniLoG&rsquo;s approach as well:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The basic principle underlying the design and elaboration of
UniLoG has been to start with a formal description of an abstract load model and thereafter
to use an interface-dependent adapter to map the abstract requests to the concrete requests
as they are “understood” by the service providing component at the real interface in question.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It also does a nice job of exploring ways to generate requests, although again coming back to
either using logs of existing traffic or generating a model which defines your workload. There
is an interesting hybrid here which would be using the distribution of actual usage as an input
for the generated load (as opposed to using load on a one to one basis).</p>

<p>That said, unfortunately, I didn&rsquo;t really get much out of it.</p>

        <p>Stripe is starting to <a href="https://stripe.com/jobs/positions/engineering-manager-infrastructure">build out a load generation team in Seattle</a> (that&rsquo;s a posting for San Francisco,
but also works for Seattle), and consequently I&rsquo;ve
been thinking more about load generation lately. In particular, I&rsquo;ve been thinking that I know
a lot less about the topic than I&rsquo;d like to, so here is a collection of sources and reading notes.</p>

<p>Hopefully, I&rsquo;ll  synthesize these into something readable soon!</p>

<h3>The Interesting Questions</h3>

<p>Perhaps because many companies never develop a mature solution for load generation,
and because none of the open source solutions command broad awareness (except maybe JMeter?),
it tends to be a place with far more opinions than average, and consequently there
are quite a few interesting questions to think through.</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s start by exploring a few of those.</p>

<ol>
<li><p><strong>Should you be load testing?</strong> Surprisingly few companies invest much into load testing,
so it&rsquo;s never entirely clear if you <em>should</em> be investing at a given point in time.
My anecdotal impression is that companies which &ldquo;believe in QA&rdquo; tend to invest into load
testing early, because they have dedicated people who can build the tooling and integration,
and that most other companies tend to ignore it until they&rsquo;re doing a significant amount of
unplanned scalability investment. Said differently, for most companies
load testing is a mechanism to convert unplanned scalability work into planned scalability work.</p></li>

<li><p><strong>Should you be load testing, redux?</strong> Beyond whether you should invest into building load testing tooling,
<a href="https://twitter.com/davinbogan">my colleague Davin</a> suggested an interesting perspective
that most of the metrics generated by load testing can also be obtained through thoughtful
instrumentation and analysis of your existing traffic.</p></li>

<li><p><strong>What layer of your infrastructure should you load test against?</strong>
Depending on the application you&rsquo;re running, it may be easy to generate load against your external interfaces (website, API, etc)
but as you go deeper into your infrastructure you may want to run load
against a specific service or your stateful systems (Kafka, databases, etc).</p></li>

<li><p><strong>What environment should you run your tests against?</strong> Perhaps the most common argument when
rolling out load testing is whether you should run it against an existing QA environment,
against a dedicated performance environment, or against your production environment.
This depends a great deal on the layer you&rsquo;re testing at, and if you&rsquo;re doing load
(how does the system react to this traffic?) or stress (at what load does the system fail?)
testing.</p></li>

<li><p><strong>How should you model your traffic?</strong> Starting with the dead simple <a href="https://github.com/JoeDog/siege">Siege</a>,
there are quite a few different ways to think about generating your load.
Should you reply a few requests at higher concurrency? Should you model your traffic using
a state machine (codified in a simple script, or perhaps in a DSL), or should you just replay
sanitized production traffic?</p></li>

<li><p><strong>Is the distinction between integration testing and load testing just a matter of scale?</strong>
As you start thinking about it, integration testing is running requests against a server and
ensuring the results are reasonable, and that&rsquo;s pretty much the exact same thing as
load testing. It&rsquo;s pretty tempting to try to solve both problems with one tool.</p></li>

<li><p><strong>How should you configure load tests? Where should that configuration live?</strong>
Merging into the whole &ldquo;is configuration code?&rdquo; debate, where should the configuration
for your load tests live? Ideally it would be in your service&rsquo;s repository, right?
Or perhaps it should be stored in a dynamic configuration database somewhere to
allow more organic exploration and testing? Hmm.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Alright then, with those questions in mind, time to read some papers.</p>

<a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/devel/static/warm-standby.html#streaming-replication-slots">replication slots</a>,
a facility holding a way to retain WAL data in pg_xlog depending on
the data consumed by clients connected to it. The feature spoken about
here has been implemented by the following commit:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>Add support for temporary replication slots

This allows creating temporary replication slots that are removed
automatically at the end of the session or on error.

From: Petr Jelinek &lt;petr.jelinek@2ndquadrant.com&gt;
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>As the commit log already mentions, replication slots have the possibility
to be made temporary. When created, they are associated with the connection
that created them, and once the connection session finishes, the slots are
automatically dropped. Note as well that the slots have no consistent data
on disk, so on crash those are of course dropped as well (it’s not like
Postgres crashes a lot anyway, per its reputation for stability).</p>

<p>One direct application of this feature is the case where WAL segments are
needed by this client and that they absolutely need this data to be consistent
with what has been done and that the slot is a one-shot need. In existing
Postgres versions, any application can create a slot, be it via SQL or
the replication protocol, though any failure results in a cleanup logic
that needs to be done or WAL would be retained infinitely if the cleanup
work does not happen. At this end that would crash the backend once the
partition holding pg_xlog gets full.</p>

<p>Once this commit has been done,
<a href="https://www.postgresql.org/message-id/CABUevEzviwzspA3XUkXpK-H6UL-9t3=C=7Bw-qJMgCYjLDed9A@mail.gmail.com">a patch has been sent</a>
for pg_basebackup to make use of temporary slots. This is a perfect match
for the use of temporary replication slots as many users are already using
the stream mode of pg_basebackup to fetch the WAL segments with a secundary
replication connection to be sure that segments are included to make a full
consistent backup that can be used as-is when restoring an instance.</p>

<p>The main risk of using pg_basebackup without replication slots is to
not be able to take a consistent backup as WAL segments may have been
already recycled. This can be mitigated using the backend-side parameter
wal_keep_segments but this is not exact science. This risk is higher
with the fetch mode, still it exists as well with the stream mode.
Since Postgres 9.6, replication slots can be used but those need to
be permanent so there is a risk to cause the bloat of pg_xlog in case
of repetitive failures of backup creation. Any backup application logic
should do cleanup of existing replication slots to avoid this problem…
So considering all that temporary replication slots for pg_basebackup
are really useful. In other potential applications, pg_receivexlog could
benefit from it as well.</p>

<p>Temporary replication slots can be created in two ways. First using the
replication protocol.</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>$ psql -d "replication=1"
=# CREATE_REPLICATION_SLOT temp_slot TEMPORARY PHYSICAL;
 slot_name | consistent_point | snapshot_name | output_plugin
-----------+------------------+---------------+---------------
 temp_slot | 0/0              | null          | null
(1 row)
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>The second way is by using directly the existing SQL functions
pg_create_physical_replication_slot() and
pg_create_logical_replication_slot() that have been extended with a
third argument defaulting to false to define if the slot created is
temporary or not:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>=# SELECT * FROM pg_create_physical_replication_slot('temp_slot_2', false, true);
  slot_name  | xlog_position
-------------+---------------
 temp_slot_2 | null
(1 row)
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>Note that as long at the session is active other sessions can check if the
slot is present. The system view pg_replication_slots has as well been
extended with a column called “temporary” to track the persistency of the
slot.</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>=# SELECT slot_name, temporary FROM pg_replication_slots;
  slot_name  | temporary
-------------+-----------
 temp_slot   | t
 temp_slot_2 | t
(1 row)
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>And one those sessions are over, so are the created slot. It is of course
possible to reserve immediately WAL on a temporary slot.</p>

If you have a one-to-many relationship, you can edit the parent and its children in the same form. However, you are limited in a way that you cannot have inlines under inlines at nested one-to-many relations. For example, you can't show models <code>Painter</code>, <code>Picture</code>, and <code>Review</code> in the same form if one <strong>painter</strong> may have drawn multiple <strong>pictures</strong> and each <strong>picture</strong> may have several <strong>reviews</strong>.</p> <p>In this article I would like to share a workaround allowing you to quickly access the inlines of an inline model. The idea is that for every inline you can provide a HTML link leading to the separate form where you can edit the related model and its own relations. It's as simple as that.</p> <p>For example, in the form of <code>Painter</code> model, you have the instances of <code>Picture</code> listed with specific links "Edit this Picture separately":</p> <img border="0" src="https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-_dnJS_4sgVA/WFF_qUh6oeI/AAAAAAAABw8/1OvFUeVcDAM4Fdc0vu2WfLNrwnyb1XnagCLcB/s1600/painter-fullpage.png" /> <p>When such a link is clicked, the administrator goes to the form of the <code>Picture</code> model which shows the instances of <code>Review</code> model listed underneath:</p> <img border="0" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-LKT31vHsjQU/WFCbSBaeb-I/AAAAAAAABv0/Bokt-STUvm0vIVRNPw-z3HNPcnYwTSYBACLcB/s1600/picture-fullpage.png" /> <p>Let's have a look, how to implement this.</p> <p>First of all, I will create a <code>gallery</code> app and define the three models there. Nothing fancy here. The important part there is just that the <code>Picture</code> model has a foreign key to the <code>Painter</code> model and the <code>Review</code> model has a foreign key to the <code>Picture</code> model.</p>  <pre><code><strong># <a href="https://gist.github.com/archatas/3dd5d271e72f1731d10981344af42813#file-models-py">gallery/models.py</a></strong><br /># -*- coding: UTF-8 -*-<br />from __future__ import unicode_literals<br /><br />import os<br /><br />from django.db import models<br />from django.utils.encoding import python_2_unicode_compatible<br />from django.utils.translation import ugettext_lazy as _<br />from django.utils.text import slugify<br /><br /><br />@python_2_unicode_compatible<br />class <strong>Painter</strong>(models.Model):<br />    name = models.CharField(_("Name"), max_length=255)<br /><br />    class Meta:<br />        verbose_name = _("Painter")<br />        verbose_name_plural = _("Painters")<br /><br />    def __str__(self):<br />        return self.name<br /><br /><br />def upload_to(instance, filename):<br />    filename_base, filename_ext = os.path.splitext(filename)<br />    return "painters/{painter}/{filename}{extension}".format(<br />        painter=slugify(instance.painter.name),<br />        filename=slugify(filename_base),<br />        extension=filename_ext.lower(),<br />    )<br /><br />@python_2_unicode_compatible<br />class <strong>Picture</strong>(models.Model):<br />    painter = models.ForeignKey(Painter, verbose_name=_("Painter"), on_delete=models.CASCADE)<br />    title = models.CharField(_("Title"), max_length=255)<br />    picture = models.ImageField(_("Picture"), upload_to=upload_to)<br /><br />    class Meta:<br />        verbose_name = _("Picture")<br />        verbose_name_plural = _("Pictures")<br /><br />    def __str__(self):<br />        return self.title<br /><br /><br />@python_2_unicode_compatible<br />class <strong>Review</strong>(models.Model):<br />    picture = models.ForeignKey(Picture, verbose_name=_("Picture"), on_delete=models.CASCADE)<br />    reviewer = models.CharField(_("Reviewer name"), max_length=255)<br />    comment = models.TextField(_("Comment"))<br /><br />    class Meta:<br />        verbose_name = _("Review")<br />        verbose_name_plural = _("Reviews")<br /><br />    def __str__(self):<br />        return self.reviewer<br /></code></pre> <p>Then I will create the administration definition for the models of the <code>gallery</code> app. Here I will set two types of administration for the <code>Picture</code> model:</p><ul><li>By extending <code>admin.StackedInline</code> I will create administration stacked as inline.</li><li>By extending <code>admin.ModelAdmin</code> I will create administration in a separate form.</li></ul> <p>In Django model administration besides usual form fields, you can also include some computed values. This can be done by your <code>fields</code> (or <code>fieldsets</code>) and <code>readonly_fields</code> attributes referring to a callable or a method name.</p> <p>You can set a translatable label for those computed values by defining <code>short_description</code> attribute for the callable or method. If you want to render some HTML, you can also set the <code>allow_tags</code> attribute to <code>True</code> (otherwise your HTML string will be escaped).</p> <pre><code><strong># <a href="https://gist.github.com/archatas/3dd5d271e72f1731d10981344af42813#file-admin-py">gallery/admin.py</a></strong><br /># -*- coding: UTF-8 -*-<br />from django.contrib import admin<br />from django.core.urlresolvers import reverse<br />from django.utils.translation import ugettext_lazy as _<br />from django.utils.text import force_text<br /><br />from .models import Painter, Picture, Review<br /><br />def get_picture_preview(obj):<br />    if obj.pk:  # if object has already been saved and has a primary key, show picture preview<br />        return """&lt;a href="{src}" target="_blank">&lt;img src="{src}" alt="{title}" style="max-width: 200px; max-height: 200px;" />&lt;/a>""".format(<br />            src=obj.picture.url,<br />            title=obj.title,<br />        )<br />    return _("(choose a picture and save and continue editing to see the preview)")<br />get_picture_preview.allow_tags = True<br />get_picture_preview.short_description = _("Picture Preview")<br /><br /><br />class PictureInline(admin.StackedInline):<br />    model = Picture<br />    extra = 0<br />    fields = ["get_edit_link", "title", "picture", get_picture_preview]<br />    readonly_fields = ["get_edit_link", get_picture_preview]<br /><br />    def get_edit_link(self, obj=None):<br />        if obj.pk:  # if object has already been saved and has a primary key, show link to it<br />            url = reverse('admin:%s_%s_change' % (obj._meta.app_label, obj._meta.model_name), args=[force_text(obj.pk)])<br />            return """&lt;a href="{url}">{text}&lt;/a>""".format(<br />                url=url,<br />                text=_("Edit this %s separately") % obj._meta.verbose_name,<br />            )<br />        return _("(save and continue editing to create a link)")<br />    get_edit_link.short_description = _("Edit link")<br />    get_edit_link.allow_tags = True<br /><br /><br />@admin.register(Painter)<br />class PainterAdmin(admin.ModelAdmin):<br />    save_on_top = True<br />    fields = ["name"]<br />    inlines = [PictureInline]<br /><br /><br />class ReviewInline(admin.StackedInline):<br />    model = Review<br />    extra = 0<br />    fields = ["reviewer", "comment"]<br /><br /><br />@admin.register(Picture)<br />class PictureAdmin(admin.ModelAdmin):<br />    save_on_top = True<br />    fields = ["painter", "title", "picture", get_picture_preview]<br />    readonly_fields = [get_picture_preview]<br />    inlines = [ReviewInline]<br /></code></pre> <p>In this administration setup, the <code>get_edit_link()</code> method creates a HTML link between the inline and the separate administration form for the <code>Picture</code> model.  As you can see, I also added the <code>get_picture_preview()</code> function as a bonus. It is included in both administration definitions for the <code>Picture</code> model and its purpose is to show a preview of the uploaded picture after saving it.</p> <p>To recap, nested inlines are not supported by Django out of the box. However, you can have your inlines edited in a separate page with the forms linked to each other. For the linking you would use some magic of the <code>readonly_fields</code> attribute.</p> <p>What if you really need to have inlines under inlines in your project?

        <p>Postgres is great, but it can&#8217;t run itself in all cases. Things come up. Queries go awry. Hardware fails, and users leave transactions open for interminable lengths of time. What happens if one of these things occur while the DBA themselves has a hardware fault? While they&#8217;re down for maintenance, someone still has to keep an eye on things. For the last PG Phriday of the year completely unrelated to my upcoming surgery, let&#8217;s talk about what happens when your DBA becomes inoperative due to medical complications.</p>

<p>This is Fake Postgres DBA 101!</p>

<h3>Getting Around</h3>

<p>When in doubt, SSH is the name of the game. Database accounts are either locked-down or lack sufficient permissions to do everything, but usually the postgres user itself has total access. Invoke your favorite SSH client to connect to the host running the database in question, and use <code>sudo</code> to become the postgres user:</p>


<div class="wp_syntax"><table><tr><td class="code"><pre class="bash" style="font-family: monospace;"><span style="color: #c20cb9; font-weight: bold;">ssh</span> my-db-host
<span style="color: #c20cb9; font-weight: bold;">sudo</span> <span style="color: #c20cb9; font-weight: bold;">su</span> <span style="color: #660033;">-l</span> postgres</pre></td></tr></table></div>


<p>Afterwards, it&#8217;s a good idea to add our public key to the postgres user&#8217;s <code>.ssh/authorized_keys</code> file so we can log in as the postgres user without the intermediate sudo. Here&#8217;s a <a href="https://www.howtoforge.com/ssh_key_based_logins_putty">good guide</a> for doing that. If there&#8217;s configuration management like salt or Puppet involved, that file is probably part of the stack and needs to be modified there or it&#8217;ll be overwritten.</p>

<p>Either way, we&#8217;re in. If we&#8217;re lucky enough to be on a Debian derivative like Ubuntu or Mint, we can use the <code>pg_lsclusters</code> command to see which database instances are running on this server. Here&#8217;s what that looks like on a sample VM:</p>


<div class="wp_syntax"><table><tr><td class="code"><pre class="bash" style="font-family: monospace;">pg_lsclusters 
&nbsp;

<p>The next thing we need is the <code>psql</code> command-line client&#8212;the nexus of Postgres interoperability. Postgres instances monitor the listed port for connection attempts, so if we wanted to target a specific instance, we&#8217;d want to refer to this output. The default is 5432 if we don&#8217;t pass any value.</p>

<p>Let&#8217;s get a list of all databases in the 96test Postgres instance on this system.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve covered the <a href="http://bonesmoses.org/2016/06/03/pg-phriday-rapid-prototyping/">template databases</a>, and they can safely be ignored. The only &#8220;real&#8221; databases in this installation are examples, postgres, and sensors. The postgres database is a default and is often used as scratch space; hopefully nobody is using it as their actual production database.</p>

<p>Each of these is distinct and can not interact with the data contained in the others. Admins familiar with other database engines might find this odd, but that&#8217;s how Postgres works. Usually databases that require lots of data sharing use schemas to keep tables in namespaces within the database. And of course, I have a <a href="http://bonesmoses.org/2016/02/12/pg-phriday-database-and-schema-basics/">long-winded explanation</a> of this as well.</p>

<p>Either way, we have a list of databases from the instance we want to examine. How do we connect? Well, if the <code>-l</code> flag shows us a list of available databases, what happens if we remove it and append the name of a database?</p>

<p>Sweet! we connected to the <code>sensors</code> database, successfully executed a basic query, and got a bit of assistance from the client software itself. The <code>psql</code> client is an extremely robust tool for interacting with a Postgres database. There are a lot of shortcut commands, and entering <code>\?</code> lists <em>all</em> of them. Be ready to scroll!</p>

<p>The one that really matters is <code>\d</code> and its variants. It&#8217;s short for &#8220;describe&#8221; and does exactly that. It can retrieve lists of tables, schemas, views, indexes, or any other database object. It can also provide greater detail about the object in question. Let&#8217;s use it to list the available schemas, see the contents of a schema, and get more insight on a particular table.</p>

<p>The <code>\dn</code> command shows the namespaces in the current database. From that list, we see that the <code>logs</code> schema might have something interesting in it. So we then rely on <code>\dt</code> to list all of the tables the logs schema contains. From there, we can just use the regular <code>\d</code> describe command to get all of the information Postgres has about the structure of the <code>logs.sensor</code> table, complete with indexes, constraints, triggers, and so on.</p>

<p>Now that we can properly introspect to see where we are, it&#8217;s time to look deeper.</p>

<h3>Peering Into the Void</h3>

<p>A common action upon connecting to a database is to view connections and see what they&#8217;re doing. This is when we turn to the Postgres system catalog, a series of tables and views that reflect the current state of the database. The <code>pg_stat_activity</code> view will tell us anything we need to know regarding user connections. For example:</p>

<p>The first query is a pretty basic terse listing of the activity of all clients. We noticed one of them was idle within a transaction and decided to view everything Postgres knew about that connection. From the various listed times, we can see that it&#8217;s only been idle for a few seconds, so there&#8217;s no cause for alarm. We can also see the last query the user executed against the database, even if it completed long ago. This is all useful debugging information.</p>

<p>Viewing all of that as a single row would have been extremely inconvenient, so we utilized another of the <code>psql</code> commands and used <code>\x</code> to enable extended output. When this option is active, <code>psql</code> presents every column within a result as a key/value row pair. It&#8217;s not especially convenient for hundreds or thousands of rows, but it&#8217;s pretty indispensable when viewing the results of a wide column list.</p>

<p>A good combination of the columns in the <code>pg_stat_activity</code> view might look something like this:</p>

<p>This query only reports non-idle connections prioritized by activity duration. From here, we can see that the connection that was idle in transaction is still idle several minutes later. Nothing is waiting on it, but maybe it&#8217;s time to clean up a bit anyway.</p>

<h3>The Terminator</h3>

<p>Maybe that idle connection is blocking someone and it needs to go away. There are two ways to make that happen directly within Postgres. The first and safest option is to try and cancel the offending query with <code>pg_cancel_backend</code>. If that doesn&#8217;t work, we escalate to <code>pg_terminate_backend</code> which actually breaks the connection and rolls back any pending transactions. Let&#8217;s try those now:</p>

<p>The <code>pg_cancel_backend</code> function didn&#8217;t &#8220;work&#8221; because it only cancels the currently operating query. If there&#8217;s a transaction in place, the user will simply return to their database prompt. An application that was stuck <em>may</em> be fixed by canceling a stuck query. If the application is threaded, it may have started a transaction and is injecting commands as another portion of the program does work elsewhere. If that process gets interrupted, the transaction may never complete.</p>

<p>That&#8217;s when we roll out <code>pg_terminate_backend</code>, which discards such polite approaches. This is the kill shot most DBAs are familiar with. Queries are canceled. Transactions are rolled back. Connections are broken. Resources are reclaimed. This isn&#8217;t quite cold-blooded murder, though. From the perspective of Postgres, we&#8217;re merely pointing a rifle at the offending connection and politely requesting it to vacate the premises.</p>

<h3>Unlimited Cosmic Power</h3>

<p>For DBAs more comfortable with GUIs, <a href="https://www.pgadmin.org/docs/">pgAdmin</a> might be a better interface than <code>psql</code>. Version 3 is a stand-alone client for Windows, Linux, or OSX. In smaller environments, it&#8217;s not entirely uncommon to already have connection capabilities to servers hosting Postgres instances. Just connect and thrill in exploring the drilldown menus, object creation scripts, query interface, and all of the other niceties it provides.</p>

<p>Many of the operations that really matter, like terminating unruly connections, are only available to superusers. There are a couple ways to get this kind of access. In a pinch, it&#8217;s easy to connect to the host server as above and grant superuser access directly to ourselves from <code>psql</code>:</p>


<div class="wp_syntax"><table><tr><td class="code"><pre class="sql" style="font-family: monospace;"><span style="color: #993333; font-weight: bold;">ALTER</span> <span style="color: #993333; font-weight: bold;">USER</span> sthomas <span style="color: #993333; font-weight: bold;">WITH</span> SUPERUSER;
&nbsp;
\du sthomas
&nbsp;
           List <span style="color: #993333; font-weight: bold;">OF</span> roles
 <span style="color: #993333; font-weight: bold;">ROLE</span> name <span style="color: #66cc66;">|</span> Attributes <span style="color: #66cc66;">|</span> Member <span style="color: #993333; font-weight: bold;">OF</span> 
<span style="color: #808080; font-style: italic;">-----------+------------+-----------</span>
 sthomas   <span style="color: #66cc66;">|</span> Superuser  <span style="color: #66cc66;">|</span> <span style="color: #66cc66;">&#123;</span><span style="color: #66cc66;">&#125;</span></pre></td></tr></table></div>


<p>Hopefully though, the current DBA set aside a dedicated role for this kind of thing. Giving users direct superuser access is usually frowned upon. Imagine we have a <code>sysdba</code> role with superuser capabilities and we want to share in the glory. This would be the correct approach:</p>


<div class="wp_syntax"><table><tr><td class="code"><pre class="sql" style="font-family: monospace;"><span style="color: #993333; font-weight: bold;">ALTER</span> <span style="color: #993333; font-weight: bold;">USER</span> sthomas <span style="color: #993333; font-weight: bold;">WITH</span> NOSUPERUSER;
&nbsp;
<span style="color: #993333; font-weight: bold;">GRANT</span> sysdba <span style="color: #993333; font-weight: bold;">TO</span> sthomas;
&nbsp;
\du s<span style="color: #66cc66;">*</span>
&nbsp;
                  List <span style="color: #993333; font-weight: bold;">OF</span> roles
 <span style="color: #993333; font-weight: bold;">ROLE</span> name <span style="color: #66cc66;">|</span>       Attributes        <span style="color: #66cc66;">|</span> Member <span style="color: #993333; font-weight: bold;">OF</span> 
<span style="color: #808080; font-style: italic;">-----------+-------------------------+-----------</span>
 sthomas   <span style="color: #66cc66;">|</span>                         <span style="color: #66cc66;">|</span> <span style="color: #66cc66;">&#123;</span>sysdba<span style="color: #66cc66;">&#125;</span>
 sysdba    <span style="color: #66cc66;">|</span> Superuser<span style="color: #66cc66;">,</span> Cannot login <span style="color: #66cc66;">|</span> <span style="color: #66cc66;">&#123;</span><span style="color: #66cc66;">&#125;</span></pre></td></tr></table></div>


<p>However we should note that since it&#8217;s the role with superuser access, we aren&#8217;t actually superusers. Like with <code>sudo</code>, we need to &#8220;activate&#8221; our new powers before they&#8217;ll work. Postgres allows users to adopt roles they&#8217;re members of. If we wanted to perform superuser actions in Postgres from pgAdmin, we could issue this command from a query pane:</p>


<div class="wp_syntax"><table><tr><td class="code"><pre class="sql" style="font-family: monospace;"><span style="color: #993333; font-weight: bold;">SET</span> <span style="color: #993333; font-weight: bold;">ROLE</span> sysdba;</pre></td></tr></table></div>


<p>Is there more? Oh, there&#8217;s a lot more. But this is enough for a competent techie to start digging around and becoming familiar with the territory. Quick, seize control while the DBA isn&#8217;t around to stop you! They&#8217;ll never know! Viva la resistance!</p>

<p>Of course, an experienced Postgres DBA <em>will</em> know <em>and</em> revoke your abilities later, but it&#8217;s fun to pretend. Take the opportunity to learn more anyway; just be careful on production systems.</p>

        </p>

        <p>Citus is a distributed database that extends (not forks) PostgreSQL. Citus does this by transparently sharding database tables across the cluster and replicating those shards.</p>

<p>After open sourcing Citus, <a href="https://github.com/citusdata/citus/issues/403">one question that we frequently heard</a> from users related to how Citus replicated data and automated node failovers. In this blog post, we intend to cover the two replication models available in Citus: statement-based and streaming replication. We also plan to describe how these models evolved over time for different use cases. </p>

<p>Going back to Citus’ first version, one of the early use cases that we looked at was analyzing large volumes of event data in real-time. This data has the nice property that they are append-only and have a natural time dimension. Users could therefore batch those events together and load them into the distributed cluster.</p>

<p>These properties of event data enabled parallel loads of events data, without sacrificing from consistency semantics, relatively easy. A coordinator node would keep metadata related to shards and shard placements (replicas) in the cluster. Clients would then talk to the coordinator node and exchange metadata on which shards to append events data. Once a client appended related events data to the related shards, the client would conclude the operation by updating the shard metadata on the coordinator node.</p>

<p><img alt="Citus cluster ingesting append-only events data from files" src="https://www.citusdata.com/../../../../assets/images/blog/citus-batch-append-event-527c025d.jpg" /></p>

<p>The simplified diagram above shows an example data load. The client tells the coordinator node that it wants to append events data to an append-distributed table. The coordinator node grants the client information about shard 6’s placements. The client then copies these events to the shard’s placements and updates the coordinator with related metadata. If the client fails to copy events to one of the nodes, it can either mark the related shard placement as invalid or abort the copy operation.</p>

<p>There are three important points to highlight in this example.</p>

<ol>
<li>The method above is known as statement-based replication and it provides automated failover in a relatively simple way.</li>
<li>If the coordinator node becomes unavailable, you need to restart it or fail it over. The fact that the coordinator node only holds small and slowly changing metadata helps.</li>
<li>Events data is immutable. Loading it into the cluster changes the shard’s state in a deterministic way. These properties make it much more amenable for use with statement based replication. In particular, different clients could load events data into the cluster in parallel, without creating conflicts with one another.</li>
</ol>

<p>We felt pretty happy about leveraging these properties in our initial release &ndash; at least for several months. After all, other distributed / analytical systems also made similar assumptions about events data, and told their users how they should be loading their data.</p>

<p>The challenge was that Postgres users had very different expectations than those of other distributed systems. Scaling your database to hundreds of machines was intriguing. But, “What do you mean you can’t update records? Isn’t this Postgres?” became an everyday question.</p>

<p>We therefore took Citus’ statement-based replication model and extended it. In this model, we also provided hash distribution as a data distribution method. This way, users could easily update and delete individual rows. Enabling update and deletes also required that we address two questions: concurrent clients updating the same row, and one of the shard replicas becoming unavailable during an update.</p>

<p>We therefore extended the coordinator node in two ways. First, the coordinator handled locking for update and delete statements touching the same shard. Second, if the coordinator node couldn’t reach a shard replica during a write operation, it would mark that replica as unhealthy. The user would then run a command to fix the unhealthy replica from the healthy one.</p>

<p>From a consistency semantics standpoint, this approach is commonly referred to as <a href="http://www.dbms2.com/2010/05/01/ryw-read-your-writes-consistency">read your writes consistency</a>.</p>

<p><img alt="Citus cluster receiving inserts and updates for user data and one shard placement becomes unavailable" src="https://www.citusdata.com/../../../../assets/images/blog/citus-insert-update-user-66fbd116.jpg" /></p>

<p>We first released these improvements to statement-based replication with pg_shard. We then integrated them fully into Citus with our open source announcement. And our customers started running even more operational workloads.</p>

<p><em>The tricky thing about SQL in a distributed system is that it provides many constructs that aren’t deterministic or commutative in nature. As a result, if you allow the underlying state to diverge across different replicas, you can’t really reconcile that state (without losing data).</em></p>

<p>In particular, our customers wanted to have stronger <a href="https://www.citusdata.com/blog/2016/08/19/announcing-citus-52">transactional guarantees</a> and <a href="https://www.citusdata.com/blog/2016/11/14/introducing-citus-6">efficient joins</a>. As we added those capabilities, we also saw that our customers started using Citus for a new use-case.</p>

<p>Previously, Citus customers focused on real-time analytical workloads &ndash; they would ingest large volumes of data into the cluster and then run analytical queries that would complete under a second. With these new capabilities in Citus, we saw another use-case emerge. Our customers started building scalable <a href="https://www.citusdata.com/blog/2016/10/03/designing-your-saas-database-for-high-scalability">multi-tenant databases</a>.</p>

<p>We found that the key to scaling out a multi-tenant database is through <a href="https://www.citusdata.com/blog/2016/08/10/sharding-for-a-multi-tenant-app-with-postgres">colocating a tenant&rsquo;s data</a> from different tables within one machine. Highly scalable multi-tenant databases (for example <a href="http://static.googleusercontent.com/media/research.google.com/en//pubs/archive/41344.pdf">Google’s F1</a>) were already using table colocation; and this method made most transaction and join operations extremely efficient. It also enabled key features, such as foreign key constraints.</p>

<p>Table colocation introduced yet another challenge with statement-based replication. Let’s say that you have 200 tables that are sharded on the same dimension and colocated. If you have concurrent updates to 10 of the tables’ shards, and you fail to reach a machine that holds shard replicas, what do you do? To honor foreign key constraints, you’d need to mark all 200 shard replicas on that machine as inactive. If you did that, how does that impact high availability?</p>

<p>We talked about this challenge and other related issues <a href="https://github.com/citusdata/citus/issues/810">on Github issues</a>. In summary:</p>

<p><em>If you are building a sharded multi-tenant database (you have a highly normalized data model) and you are also looking for high availability features, then statement-based replication is often not good enough.</em></p>

<p>The reason for that is you can’t have the underlying data diverge some and then look to reconcile it. The more dependencies you have across your tables, such as foreign key constraints, the more likely it becomes that an update statement will have side-effects.</p>

<p>So what do you do if you’re building a multi-tenant database? One possibility is to reduce the replication factor to 1. If you don’t have replication, your state can’t diverge. In fact, Citus 6.0 already instructs you to reduce the replication factor if you’re using foreign keys.</p>

<p>Another option is to switch from statement-based to streaming replication. PostgreSQL has been building up on streaming replication for the past five releases now; and this replication model ensures that your changes get applied in lockstep fashion. That is, if you arrange worker nodes into replication groups, Citus can then route a request for a shard to that replication group’s primary. On the primary node, Postgres can then apply its concurrency control logic. This approach&rsquo;s architecture looks like the following:</p>

<p><img alt="Citus serving multi-tenant applications using streaming replication" src="https://www.citusdata.com/../../../../assets/images/blog/citus-streaming-replica-setup-04917fc2.jpg" /></p>

<p>The thing is, Postgres’ streaming replication isn’t exactly the most fun system to set up. On Citus Cloud, we can use our team’s immense experience with managing Postgres and the primitives available on AWS to automatically take care of things for you. For our open source deployments, we’re actively evaluating projects that make use of streaming replication easier and we’ll follow up with updates over the course of next year.</p>

<p>In the meantime, we’re also making two changes with our v6.1 release. First, we’re encouraging users who’re building scalable multi-tenant databases to use streaming replication. The easiest way to do that is through <a href="https://www.citusdata.com/product/cloud">Citus Cloud</a>.</p>

<p>Second, we recognize that our users have multiple use cases; two of them are multi-tenant applications and real-time analytics. We’d like Citus’ default behavior across all use cases to be safe, not web scale. We’re therefore reducing the default replication factor for statement replication to 1. Users can increase this setting, but we’d like to make this an explicit change &ndash; anticipating that it will raise awareness about statement-based replication and its drawbacks for the multi-tenant use case. We’re also capturing this change, its motivations and technical details <a href="https://github.com/citusdata/citus/issues/998">in Github issues</a>.</p>

<p>In summary, we learned through Citus releases and talking to our customers that PostgreSQL sets different expectations. At a higher level, customers have a different mental place in their minds for a relational database (RDBMS) than a NoSQL or Hadoop based database. This makes scaling out an RDBMS hard &ndash; the more your use case expects from the database, the trickier this gets. At Citus, we will continue to address each of these challenges with every new release.</p>

<p>We hope this blog post provides a helpful insight into where Citus started its replication journey and where it’s headed. We always drive the product direction with input from our users and customers; and we’re looking forward to hearing more. If you have questions or comments for us, please drop us a line in our <a href="https://slack.citusdata.com/">Slack channel</a> or Intercom. If you’re curious about how your use case would scale, today’s as good a day as any to spin up a <a href="https://www.citusdata.com/get_started">Citus cluster</a>!</p>

                  By Caktus Consulting Group from Django community aggregator: Community blog posts.

        <p>I recently attended <a href="https://www.djangounderthehood.com/">Django Under The Hood</a> in Amsterdam, an annual gathering of Django core team members and developers from around the world. A common theme discussed at the conference this year is that “Django is boring.” While it’s not the first time this has been discussed, it still struck me as odd. Upon further reflection, however, I see Django’s “boringness” as a huge asset to the community and potential adopters of the framework.</p>
<p>Caktus first began using Django in late 2007. This was well before the release of Django 1.0, in the days when startups and established companies alike ran production web applications using Subversion “trunk” (akin to the Git “master” branch) rather than using a released version of the software. Using Django was definitely not boring, because it required reading each commit merged to see if it added a new feature you could use and to make sure it wasn’t going to break your project . Although Django kept us on our toes in the early days, it was clear that Django was growing into a robust and stable framework with hope for the future.</p>
<p>With the help of thousands of volunteers from around the world, Django’s progressed a lot since the early days of “tracking trunk.” What does it mean that the people developing Django itself consider it “boring,” and how does that change our outlook for the future of the framework? If you’re a tech startup looking for a web framework, why would you choose the “boring” option? Following are several reasons that Caktus still uses Django for all new custom web/SMS projects, reasons I think apply equally well in the startup environment.</p>
<h2>1. Django has long taken pride in its “batteries included” philosophy.</h2>
<p>Django strives to be a framework that solves common problems in web development in the best way possible. In <a href="https://www.caktusgroup.com/blog/2009/01/13/why-caktus-uses-django/">my original post</a> on the topic nearly 8 years ago, some of the key features included with Django were the built-in admin interface and a strong focus on data integrity, two features missing from Ruby on Rails, the other major web framework at the time.</p>
<p>Significant features that have arrived in Django since that time include support for aggregates and query expressions in the ORM, a built-in application for geographic applications (django.contrib.gis), a user messages framework, CSRF protection, Python 3 support, a configurable User model, improved database transaction management, support for database migrations, support for full-text search in Postgres, and countless other features, bug fixes, and security updates. The entire time, Django’s emphasis on backwards compatibility and its generous deprecation policy have made it perfectly reasonable to plan to support and grow applications over 10 years or more.</p>
<h2>2. The community around Django continues to grow.</h2>
<p>In the tradition of open source software, users of the framework new and old support each other via the mailing list, IRC channel, blog posts, StackOverflow, and cost-effective conferences around the globe. The ecosystem of reusable apps continues to grow, with 3317 packages available on <a href="https://djangopackages.org/">https://djangopackages.org/</a> as of the time of this post.</p>
<p>A common historical pattern has been for apps or features to live external to Django until they’re “proven” in production by a large number of users, after which they might be merged into Django proper. Django also recently adopted the concept of “official” packages, where a third-party app might not make sense to merge into Django proper, but it’s sufficiently important to the wider Django community that the core team agrees to take ownership of its ongoing maintenance.</p>
<p>The batteries included in Django itself and the wealth of reusable apps not only help new projects get off the ground quickly, they also provide solutions that have undergone rigorous code review by experts in the relevant fields. This is particularly important in startup environments when the focus must be on building business-critical features quickly. The last thing a startup wants to do, for example, is focus on business-critical features at the expense of security or reliability; with Django, one doesn’t have to make this compromise.</p>
<h2>3. Django is written in Python.</h2>
<p>Python is one of the <a href="http://blog.codeeval.com/codeevalblog/2016/2/2/most-popular-coding-languages-of-2016">most popular</a>, <a href="http://cacm.acm.org/blogs/blog-cacm/176450-python-is-now-the-most-popular-introductory-teaching-language-at-top-u-s-universities/fulltext">most taught</a> programming languages in the world. Availability of skilled staff is a key concern for startups hoping to grow their team in the near future, so the prevalence of Python should reassure those teams looking to grow.</p>
<p>Similarly, Python as a programming language prides itself on readability; one should be able to understand the code one wrote 6-12 months ago. Although this is by no means new nor unique to Django, Python’s straightforward approach to development is another reason some developers might consider it “boring.” Both by necessity and convention, Python espouses the idea of clarity over cleverness in code, as articulated by Brian Kernighan in <em>The Elements of Programming Style</em>. Python’s philosophy about coding style is described in more detail in <a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0020/">PEP 20 -- The Zen of Python</a>. Leveraging this philosophy helps increase readability of the code and the bus factor of the project.</p>
<h2>4. The documentation included with Django is stellar.</h2>
<p>Not only does the <a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/">documentation</a> detail the usage of each and every feature in Django, it also includes detailed release notes, including any backwards-incompatible changes, along with each release. Again, while Django’s rigorous documentation practices aren’t anything new, writing and reading documentation might be considered “boring” by some developers.</p>
<p>Django’s documentation is important for two key reasons. First, it helps both new and existing users of the framework quickly determine how to use a given feature. Second, it serves as a “contract” for backwards-compatibility in Django; that is, if a feature is documented in Django, the project pledges that it will be supported for at least two additional releases (unless it’s already been deprecated in the release notes). Django’s documentation is helpful both to one-off projects that need to be built quickly, and to projects that need to grow and improve through numerous Django releases.</p>
<h2>5. Last but not least, Django is immensely scalable.</h2>
<p>The framework is used at companies like EventBrite, Disqus, and Instagram to handle web traffic and mobile app API usage on behalf of 500M+ users. Even after being acquired by Facebook, Instagram <a href="https://youtu.be/lx5WQjXLlq8?list=PLQdy7QUATciZ4V3g3iCTnG5fvkZkuNGyg">swapped out their database server but did not abandon Django</a>. Although early startups don’t often have the luxury of worrying about this much traffic, it’s always good to know that one’s web framework can scale to handle dramatic and continuing spikes in demand.</p>
<p>At Caktus, we’ve engineered solutions for several projects using AWS Auto Scaling that create servers only when they’re needed, thereby maximizing scalability and minimizing hosting costs.</p>
<h2>Django into the future</h2>
<p>Caktus has long been a proponent of the Django framework, and I’m happy to say that remains true today. We established ourselves early on as one of the premiere web development companies specializing in Django, we’ve written previously about why we use Django in particular, and Caktus staff are regular contributors not only to Django itself but also to the wider community of open source apps and discussion surrounding the framework.</p>
<p>Django can be considered a best of breed collection of solutions to nearly all the problems common to web development and restful, mobile app API development that can be solved in generic ways. This is “boring” because most of the common problems have been solved already; there’s not a lot of low-hanging fruit for new developers to contribute. This is a good thing for startups, because it means there’s less need to build features manually that aren’t specific to the business.</p>
<p>The risk of adopting any “bleeding edge” technology is that the community behind it will lose interest and move on to something else, leaving the job of maintaining the framework up to the few companies without the budget to switch frameworks. There’s a secondary risk specific to more “fragmented” frameworks as well. Because of Django’s “batteries included” philosophy and focus on backwards compatibility, one can be assured that the features one selects today will continue to work well together in the future, which won’t always be the case with frameworks that rely on third-party packages to perform business-critical functions such as user management.</p>
<p>These risks couldn’t be any stronger in the world of web development, where the framework chosen must be considered a tried and true partner. A web framework is not a service, like a web server or a database, that can be swapped out for another similar solution with some effort. Switching web frameworks, especially if the programming language changes, may require rewriting the entire application from scratch, so it’s important to make the right choice up front. Django has matured substantially over the last 10 years, and I’m happy to celebrate that it’s now the “boring” option for web development. This means startups choosing Django today can focus more on what makes their projects special, and less on implementing common patterns in web development or struggling to perform a framework upgrade with significant, backwards-incompatible changes. It’s clear we made the right choice, and I can’t wait to see what startups adopt and grow on Django in the future.</p>

        I recently came across a discussion in #postgresql channel about how to add a new column that will represent record insert timestamps to a table with minimal locking.<br /><br />Normally you would do something like this :<br /><br />monkey=# <b>alter table alter_test add column insert_timestamp timestamp without time zone default now();</b><br />ALTER TABLE<br />Time: <b><u>13643.983 ms</u></b><br />monkey=#<b> create index concurrently insert_timestamp_idx on alter_test (insert_timestamp) where insert_timestamp is not null;</b><br />CREATE INDEX<br />Time: 1616.108 ms<br /><br />This though , would require an&nbsp;AccessExclusiveLock on the table and the application would have to wait for the duration of alter.<br />What you could do instead is :<br /><br />monkey=#<b> alter table alter_test add column insert_timestamp timestamp without time zone;</b><br />ALTER TABLE<br />Time: <b><u>1.135 ms</u></b><br />monkey=# <b>alter table alter_test alter column insert_timestamp set default now();</b><br />ALTER TABLE<br />Time: <b><u>1.238 ms</u></b><br />monkey=# create index concurrently insert_timestamp_idx on alter_test (insert_timestamp) where insert_timestamp is not null;<br />CREATE INDEX<br />Time: 1618.788 ms<br /><br />As you can see the timings are completely different, in the first case the database has to change data in all pre-existing rows, which isn't really needed since the value will be dummy (it will default to the transaction time).<br />The second way will also require an AccessExclusiveLock but it wont have to change any data ignoring the old rows so the lock should be almost instant (assuming no blockers exist),<br />next step you alter the table adding the default value and from now on the new column will have the default value. If you don't want to have nulls, or you want to add a not null constraint to the column, you can update the old (null) rows in a more progressive and non intrusive way later on.<br /><br />Thanks for reading<br />- Vasilis Ventirozos

            <h2>Using Fanout.io in Django</h2>
        </a>

        <p class="discreet">
            
                  By Peter Bengtsson from Django community aggregator: Community blog posts.
            
            
            
                Published on <span name="publication_time">Dec 13, 2016</span>.
            
        </p>

        <p>Earlier this year we started using <a href="https://fanout.io/">Fanout.io</a> in <a href="https://air.mozilla.org/">Air Mozilla</a> to enhance the experience for users awaiting content updates. Here I hope to flesh out its details a bit to inspire others to deploy a similar solution.  </p>
<h2>What It Is</h2>
<p>First of all, Fanout.io is basically a service that handles your WebSockets. You put in some of Fanout's JavaScript into your site that handles a persistent WebSocket connection between your site and Fanout.io. And to push messages to your user you basically send them to Fanout.io from the server and they "forward" it to the WebSocket.  </p>
<p>The HTML page looks like this:  </p>
<div class="highlight">

<pre><span></span><span class="p">&lt;</span><span class="nt">html</span><span class="p">&gt;</span>
<span class="p">&lt;</span><span class="nt">body</span><span class="p">&gt;</span>

  <span class="p">&lt;</span><span class="nt">h1</span><span class="p">&gt;</span>Web Page<span class="p">&lt;/</span><span class="nt">h1</span><span class="p">&gt;</span>

<span class="c">&lt;!-- replace the FANOUT_REALM_ID with the ID you get in the Fanout.io admin page --&gt;</span>
<span class="p">&lt;</span><span class="nt">script</span> 
  <span class="na">src</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s">&quot;https://{{ FANOUT_REALM_ID }}.fanoutcdn.com/bayeux/static/faye-browser-1.1.2-fanout1-min.js&quot;</span>

<span class="p">&lt;</span><span class="nt">script</span> <span class="na">src</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s">&quot;fanout.js&quot;</span><span class="p">&gt;&lt;/</span><span class="nt">script</span><span class="p">&gt;</span>

<span class="p">&lt;/</span><span class="nt">html</span><span class="p">&gt;</span>
</pre></div>

<p>And the <code>fanout.js</code> script looks like this:<br />
<div class="highlight"></p>
<pre><span></span><span class="nb">window</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">onload</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="kd">function</span><span class="p">()</span> <span class="p">{</span>

<p>Note that, in the client-side code, there's no security since there's no authentication. Any client can connect to any channel. So it's important that you don't send anything sensitive. In fact, you should think of this pattern simply as a <em>hint</em> that something has changed. For example, here's a slightly more fleshed out example of how you'd use the subscription.  </p>

<p>Yes, I know jQuery isn't hip but it demonstrates the pattern well. Also, in the real world you might not want to ask the server for <em>all</em> comments (and re-render) but instead do an AJAX query to get all <em>new</em> comments since some parameter or something.  </p>
<h2>Why It's Awesome</h2>
<p>It's awesome because you can have a simple page that updates near instantly when the server's database is updated. The alternative would be to do a <code>setInterval</code> loop that frequently does an AJAX query to see if there's new content to update. This is cumbersome because it requires a lot heavier AJAX queries. You might want to make it secure so you engage sessions that need to be looked up each time. Or, since you're going to request it often you have to write a very optimized server-side endpoint that is cheap to query often.  </p>
<p>And last but not least, if you rely on an AJAX loop interval, you have to pick a frequency that your server can cope with and it's likely to be in the range of several seconds or else it might overload the server. That means that updates are quite delayed.  </p>
<p>But maybe most important, you don't need to worry about running a WebSocket server. It's not terribly hard to do one yourself on your laptop with a bit of Node Express or Tornado but now you have yet another server to maintain and it, internally, needs to be connected to a "pub-sub framework" like Redis or a full blown message queue.  </p>
<h2>Alternatives</h2>
<p>Fanout.io is not the only service that offers this. The decision to use Fanout.io was taken about a year ago and one of the attractive things it offers is that it's got a freemium option which is ideal for doing local testing. The honest truth is that I can't remember the other justifications used to chose Fanout.io over its competitors but here are some alternatives that popped up on a quick search:  </p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://socketize.com/">Socketize</a> </li>
<li><a href="https://pusher.com/">Pusher</a></li>
<li><a href="http://pushpin.org/">pushping</a></li>
</ul>
<p>It seems they all (including Fanout.io) has freemium plans, supports authentication, REST APIs (for sending and for querying connected clients' stats).  </p>
<p>There are also some more advanced feature packed solutions like Meteor, Firebase and GunDB that act more like databases that are connected via WebSockets or alike. For example, you can have a database as a "conduit" for pushing data to a client. Meaning, instead of sending the data from the server directly you save it in a database which syncs to the connected clients.  </p>
<p>Lastly, I've heard that Heroku has a really neat solution that does something similar whereby it sets up something similar as an extension.  </p>
<h2>Let's Get Realistic</h2>
<p>The solution sketched out above is very simplistic. There are a lot more fine-grained details that you'd probably want to zoom in to if you're going to do this properly.  </p>
<h3>Throttling</h3>
<p>In Air Mozilla, we call <code>fanout.publish(channel, message)</code> from a <code>post_save</code> ORM signal. If you have a lot of saves for some reason, you might be sending too many messages to the client. A throttling solution, per channel, simply makes sure your "callback" gets called only once per channel per small time frame. Here's the solution we employed:  </p>

<h3>Subresource Integrity</h3>
<p><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Security/Subresource_Integrity">Subresource integrity</a> is an important web security technique where you know in advance a hash of the remote JavaScript you include. That means that if someone hacks the result of loading <code>https://cdn.example.com/somelib.js</code> the browser compares the hash of that with a hash mentioned in the <code>&lt;script&gt;</code> tag and refuses to load it if the hash doesn't match. </p>
<p>In the example of Fanout.io it actually looks like this:  </p>
<div class="highlight">

<pre><span></span><span class="p">&lt;</span><span class="nt">script</span> 
  <span class="na">src</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s">&quot;https://{{ FANOUT_REALM_ID }}.fanoutcdn.com/bayeux/static/faye-browser-1.1.2-fanout1-min.js&quot;</span>
  <span class="na">crossOrigin</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s">&quot;anonymous&quot;</span>
  <span class="na">integrity</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s">&quot;sha384-/9uLm3UDnP3tBHstjgZiqLa7fopVRjYmFinSBjz+FPS/ibb2C4aowhIttvYIGGt9&quot;</span>
<span class="p">&gt;&lt;/</span><span class="nt">script</span><span class="p">&gt;</span>
</pre></div>

<p>The SHA you get from the Fanout.io documentation. It requires, and implies, that you need to use an exact version of the library. You can't use it like this: <code>&lt;script src="https://cdn.example/somelib.latest.min.js" ...</code>.  </p>
<h3>WebSockets vs. Long-polling</h3>
<p>Fanout.io's JavaScript client follows a pattern that makes it compatible with clients that don't support WebSockets. The first technique it uses is called <a href="https://www.pubnub.com/blog/2014-12-01-http-long-polling/">long-polling</a>. With this the server basically relys on standard HTTP techniques but the responses are long lasting instead. It means the request simply takes a very long time to respond and when it does, that's when data can be passed.  </p>
<p>This is not a problem for modern browsers. They almost <a href="http://caniuse.com/#search=websocket">all support WebSocket</a> but you might have an application that isn't a modern browser.  </p>
<p>Anyway, what Fanout.io does internally is that it <em>first</em> creates a long-polling connection but then shortly after tries to "upgrade" to WebSockets if it's supported. However, the projects I work only need to support modern browsers and there's a trick to tell Fanout to go straight to WebSockets:  </p>
<div class="highlight">

</pre></div>

<h3>Fallbacks</h3>
<p>In the case of Air Mozilla, it already had a traditional solution whereby it does a <code>setInterval</code> loop that does an AJAX query frequently.  </p>
<p>Because the networks can be flaky or because something might go wrong in the client, the way we use it is like this:  </p>
<div class="highlight">

<pre><span></span><span class="kd">var</span> <span class="nx">RELOAD_INTERVAL</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="mi">5</span><span class="p">;</span>  <span class="c1">// seconds</span>

    <span class="c1">// If Fanout doesn't work for some reason even though it</span>
    <span class="c1">// was made available, still use the regular old</span>
    <span class="c1">// interval. Just not as frequently.</span>
    <span class="nx">RELOAD_INTERVAL</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="mi">60</span> <span class="o">*</span> <span class="mi">5</span><span class="p">;</span>

</pre></div>

<h3>Use Fanout Selectively/Progressively</h3>
<p>In the case of Air Mozilla, there are lots of pages. Some don't ever need a WebSocket connection. For example, it might be a simple CRUD (Create Update Delete) page. So, for that I made the whole Fanout functionality "lazy" and it only gets set up if the page has some JavaScript that knows it needs it.  </p>
<p>This also has the benefit that the Fanout resource loading etc. is slightly delayed until more pressing things have loaded and the DOM is ready.  </p>
<p>You can <a href="https://github.com/mozilla/airmozilla/blob/master/airmozilla/base/static/js/fanout.js">see the whole solution here</a>. And <a href="https://github.com/mozilla/airmozilla/blob/0c6337a44c5a2842c4cbd7a8000c08a5c6be5a0f/airmozilla/comments/static/comments/js/comments.js#L252-L258">the way you use it here</a>.  </p>
<h3>Have Many Channels</h3>
<p>You can have as many channels as you like. Don't create a channel called <code>comments</code> when you can have a channel called <code>comments-123</code> where <code>123</code> is the ID of the page you're on for example.  </p>
<p>In the case of Air Mozilla, there's a channel for every single page. If you're sitting on a page with a commenting widget, it doesn't get WebSocket messages about newly posted comments on other pages.  </p>
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>We've now used Fanout for almost a year in our little Django + jQuery app and it's been great. The management pages in Air Mozilla use AngularJS and the integration looks like this in the event manager page:  </p>
<div class="highlight">

<p>Fanout.io's been great to us. Really responsive support and very reliable. But if I were to start a fresh new project that needs a solution like this I'd try to spend a little time to investigate the competitors to see if there are some neat features I'd enjoy.  </p>
<p><strong>UPDATE</strong></p>
<p>Fanout reached out to help explain more what's great about Fanout.io  </p>
<p><em>"One of Fanout's biggest differentiators is that we use and promote open technologies/standards. For example, our service supports the open Bayeux protocol, and you can connect to it with any compatible client library, such as Faye. Nearly all competing services have proprietary protocols. This "open" aspect of Fanout aligns pretty well with Mozilla's values, and in fact you'd have a hard time finding any alternative that works the same way."</em></p>

<p>ElasticTranscoder allows you to transcode files from your S3 bucket to various formats.
To set this service up first you have to create a pipeline. What pipeline is? Basically, it's
a workflow- how your transcoder should work. You can create a different pipeline for long
content and different for short one. In my application I created the following pipeline:</p>
<img alt="Pipeline configuration" src="https://www.djangoproject.com/images/aws_transcoder1.png" />
<p>As I have my pipeline configured next step is to create jobs. Jobs are tasks for a transcoder
that say which file I want to transcode, to what format or codec I want to do this:</p>
<img alt="Job details" src="https://www.djangoproject.com/images/aws_transcoder2.png" />
<p>PresetID is user created or already existing configuration that defines the format of transcoder
output: is it mp4 or maybe flac? What resolution should video files have? All of this
is set up in present.</p>
<p>As we know basic terms used in AWS Elastic Transcoder let's jump into the code.</p>

<p>Going from the top - I specified my <tt class="docutils literal">region_name</tt> as well as <tt class="docutils literal">pipeline_name</tt>
for boto3 to know to which region it should connect. In method <tt class="docutils literal">get_pipeline</tt> I
iterate through all available pipelines and return that has the same name as <tt class="docutils literal">pipeline_name</tt>.
In this function <tt class="docutils literal">paginator</tt> is an object which holds on portion of data so user
don't have to wait until all available pipelines are fetched.</p>
<p>The main logic is in <tt class="docutils literal">start_transcode</tt> method. At the beginning, I used helper function
<tt class="docutils literal">create_aws_filename</tt> that's creating proper AWS file name like <tt class="docutils literal">media/my_mp3.mp3</tt> and
returns that whole path with filename. After I created filenames for all of my files I'm
calling <tt class="docutils literal">create_job</tt> that creates a job basing on <tt class="docutils literal">pipeline_id</tt> and <tt class="docutils literal">base_filename</tt>. The job
can have multiple outputs so I specified one for wav, flac and mp4 files. How is it used in code?

<p>In <tt class="docutils literal">form_valid</tt> first I'm calling <tt class="docutils literal">save()</tt> on <tt class="docutils literal">AudioFile</tt> object which is uploading the file
to S3 bucket. Then I'm using <tt class="docutils literal">transcoder.start_transcode</tt> and basing on output from this function
I match filenames to their respective fields. I know that this solution is not the best one
as I have to call <tt class="docutils literal">save</tt> twice and if you have a better way to do this I'm glad to hear
it from you.</p>
<p>That's all for today! Transcoding works fine but there is a problem with what when files are big?
Transcoding such files will take lots of time and user don't want to wait for a response.
The solution will be revealed in next post.</p>

                  By Simple is Better Than Complex from Django community aggregator: Community blog posts.

        <p>This tutorial is about how to implement SQL-like group by queries using the Django ORM. It’s a fairly common operation,
specially for those who are familiar with SQL. The Django ORM is actually an abstraction layer, that let us play with
the database as it was object-oriented but in the end it’s just a relational database and all the operations are
translated into SQL statements.</p>

<p>Most of the work can be done retrieving the raw data from the database, and playing with it in the Python side,
grouping the data in dictionaries, iterating through it, making sums, averages and what not. But the database is a very
powerful tool and do much more than simply storing the data, and often you can do the work much faster directly in the
database.</p>

<p>Generally speaking, when you start doing group by queries, you are no longer interested in each model instances (or
in a table row) details, but you want extract new information from your dataset, based on some common aspects shared
between the model instances.</p>

<p>Let’s have a look in an example:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-python"><span class="k">class</span> <span class="nc">Country</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">models</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">Model</span><span class="p">):</span>
    <span class="n">name</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">models</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">CharField</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">max_length</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="mi">30</span><span class="p">)</span>

<span class="k">class</span> <span class="nc">City</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">models</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">Model</span><span class="p">):</span>
    <span class="n">name</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">models</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">CharField</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">max_length</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="mi">30</span><span class="p">)</span>
    <span class="n">country</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">models</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">ForeignKey</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">Country</span><span class="p">)</span>
    <span class="n">population</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">models</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">PositiveIntegerField</span><span class="p">()</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>This data is from Wikipedia, and I don’t know to what extent it is correct, but for our example it doesn’t really
matter.</p>

<p>Considering the whole dataset, if we wanted to know the total of habitants in all the 84 cities, we could perhaps use
an <code class="highlighter-rouge">aggregate</code> query:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-python"><span class="kn">from</span> <span class="nn">django.db.models</span> <span class="kn">import</span> <span class="n">Sum</span>

<span class="n">City</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">objects</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="nb">all</span><span class="p">()</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">aggregate</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">Sum</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s">'population'</span><span class="p">))</span>
<span class="p">{</span><span class="s">'population__sum'</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="mi">970880224</span><span class="p">}</span>  <span class="c"># 970,880,224</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>Or the average population in the top 84 cities:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-python"><span class="kn">from</span> <span class="nn">django.db.models</span> <span class="kn">import</span> <span class="n">Avg</span>

<span class="n">City</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">objects</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="nb">all</span><span class="p">()</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">aggregate</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">Avg</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s">'population'</span><span class="p">))</span>
<span class="p">{</span><span class="s">'population__avg'</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="mf">11558097.904761905</span><span class="p">}</span>  <span class="c"># 11,558,097.90</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>What if we now wanted to see the total population, but aggregated by the country instead? Not the whole dataset. In
this case we no longer can use <code class="highlighter-rouge">aggregate</code>, instead we will be using <code class="highlighter-rouge">annotate</code>.</p>

<p>The <code class="highlighter-rouge">aggregate</code> clause is terminal, it returns a Python dictionary, meaning you can’t append any queryset methods.
Also, it will always return a single result. So if you wanted to get the population sum by country, using <code class="highlighter-rouge">aggregate</code>,
you would need to do something like this:</p>

<div class="panel panel-danger">
  <div class="panel-header">Don't</div>

<p>While the result is correct, we needed to execute <strong>30</strong> different queries in the database. And we’ve lost some of the
capabilities of the ORM, such as ordering this result set. Perhaps the data would be more interesting if we could order
by the country with the most population for example.</p>

<p>Now a better way to do it is using <code class="highlighter-rouge">annotate</code>, which will be translated as a <strong>group by</strong> query in the database:</p>

<p>Much better, right?</p>

<p>Now if we wanted to order by the country population, we can use an alias to make it look cleaner and to use in the
<code class="highlighter-rouge">order_by()</code> clause:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-python"><span class="n">City</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">objects</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="nb">all</span><span class="p">()</span> \

<p>Here is how the last SQL query looks like:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-sql">  <span class="k">SELECT</span> <span class="nv">"core_country"</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nv">"name"</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="k">SUM</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nv">"core_city"</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nv">"population"</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="k">AS</span> <span class="nv">"country_population"</span>
    <span class="k">FROM</span> <span class="nv">"core_city"</span> <span class="k">INNER</span> <span class="k">JOIN</span> <span class="nv">"core_country"</span> <span class="k">ON</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="nv">"core_city"</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nv">"country_id"</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="nv">"core_country"</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nv">"id"</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="k">GROUP</span> <span class="k">BY</span> <span class="nv">"core_country"</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nv">"name"</span>
<span class="k">ORDER</span> <span class="k">BY</span> <span class="nv">"country_population"</span> <span class="k">DESC</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>Now an important thing to note here: it only makes sense adding in the <code class="highlighter-rouge">values()</code> clause, the data that can be grouped.
Every field you add to the <code class="highlighter-rouge">values()</code> clause, will be used to create the group by query.</p>

<p>Look at this queryset:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-python"><span class="n">City</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">objects</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="nb">all</span><span class="p">()</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">values</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s">'name'</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s">'country__name'</span><span class="p">)</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">annotate</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">Sum</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s">'population'</span><span class="p">))</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>The resulting SQL query would be:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-sql">  <span class="k">SELECT</span> <span class="nv">"core_city"</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nv">"name"</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="nv">"core_country"</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nv">"name"</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="k">SUM</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nv">"core_city"</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nv">"population"</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="k">AS</span> <span class="nv">"population__sum"</span>
    <span class="k">FROM</span> <span class="nv">"core_city"</span> <span class="k">INNER</span> <span class="k">JOIN</span> <span class="nv">"core_country"</span> <span class="k">ON</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="nv">"core_city"</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nv">"country_id"</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="nv">"core_country"</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nv">"id"</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="k">GROUP</span> <span class="k">BY</span> <span class="nv">"core_city"</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nv">"name"</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="nv">"core_country"</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nv">"name"</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>This would have no effect, because all the city names are unique, and they can’t be grouped (the database will try to
group it, but each “group” will have only 1 row/instance). We can see it simply by performing a count on each queryset:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-python"><span class="n">City</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">objects</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="nb">all</span><span class="p">()</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">values</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s">'name'</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s">'country__name'</span><span class="p">)</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">annotate</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">Sum</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s">'population'</span><span class="p">))</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">count</span><span class="p">()</span>
<span class="mi">84</span>

<span class="n">City</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">objects</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="nb">all</span><span class="p">()</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">values</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s">'country__name'</span><span class="p">)</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">annotate</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">Sum</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s">'population'</span><span class="p">))</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">count</span><span class="p">()</span>
<span class="mi">29</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>That’s what I meant when I said in the beginning of the post that, you are no longer interested in the details of each
row. When we group by country to get the sum of the population, we lost the details of the cities (at least in the
query result).</p>

<p>Sometimes it makes sense to have more than one value in the <code class="highlighter-rouge">values()</code> clause. For example if our database was composed
by City / State / Country. Then we could group by using <code class="highlighter-rouge">.values('state__name', 'country__name')</code>. This way you would
have the population by country. And you would avoid States from different countries (with the same name) to be grouped
together.</p>

<p>The values you generate on the database, using the <code class="highlighter-rouge">annotate</code> clause, can also be used to filter data. Usually in the
database we use the <code class="highlighter-rouge">HAVING</code> function, which makes it very idiomatic. You can read the query like it was plain English.
Now, in the Django side, it’s a simple <code class="highlighter-rouge">filter</code>.</p>

<p>For example, let’s say we want to see the total population by country, but only those countries where the total
population is greater than 50,000,000:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-python"><span class="n">City</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">objects</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="nb">all</span><span class="p">()</span> \
  <span class="o">.</span><span class="n">values</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s">'country__name'</span><span class="p">)</span> \
  <span class="o">.</span><span class="n">annotate</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">country_population</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="n">Sum</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s">'population'</span><span class="p">))</span> \

  <span class="o">.</span><span class="n">order_by</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s">'-country_population'</span><span class="p">)</span>

<span class="p">[</span>
  <span class="p">{</span><span class="s">'country__name'</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="s">u'China'</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s">'country_population'</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="mi">309898600</span><span class="p">},</span>

<span class="p">]</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>And finally the SQL query:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-sql">  <span class="k">SELECT</span> <span class="nv">"core_country"</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nv">"name"</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="k">SUM</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nv">"core_city"</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nv">"population"</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="k">AS</span> <span class="nv">"country_population"</span>

<p>I decided to adapt code from my previous blog series about
<a class="reference external" href="http://krzysztofzuraw.com/blog/2016/django-celery-rabbit-part-one.html">celery and rabbit-mq</a>. I did that because code
from this django application actually transcodes mp3 files to other formats. This
series will be divided into these parts:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Moving static and media files to AWS</li>
<li>Transcoding files inside AWS transcoder</li>

<p>AWS transcoder operates only on files that are inside S3 bucket so first I need
to change how these files are served in django.</p>
<p>Let's say that I already had my account on AWS. Next step is to generate specific
account using <a class="reference external" href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/introduction.html">IAM</a>.
While creating a user I want to give him access to AWS S3:</p>
<img alt="Policy for IAM user" src="https://www.djangoproject.com/images/aws1.png" />
<p>and after I download its
credentials I can create S3 container - I have chosen Ireland because with Frankfurt
I have a problem with uploading files to S3. After bucket creation, it's time to add
policy. The policy is basically JSON that tells AWS which user can access given bucket.
More information about that can be found <a class="reference external" href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/intro-managing-access-s3-resources.html">here</a>.
Adding policy is quite simple from S3 management view:</p>
<img alt="Policy for S3 bucket" src="https://www.djangoproject.com/images/aws2.png" />
<p>This policy looks like this:</p>

<span class="n">env</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">environ</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">Env</span><span class="p">()</span>

<span class="p">}</span>
<span class="n">AWS_S3_HOST</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s1">'s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com'</span>
</pre></div>
<p>I'm using here another package called <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/joke2k/django-environ">django-environ</a>.
It allows me to get certain settings from environmental variables. I'm setting them
in my virtualenvwrapper script inside <tt class="docutils literal">$ENV_PATH/bin/postactivate</tt>:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="nb">export</span> <span class="nv">AWS_STORAGE_BUCKET_NAME</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s1">'name'</span>
<span class="nb">export</span> <span class="nv">AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s1">'key'</span>
<span class="nb">export</span> <span class="nv">AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s1">'acces_id'</span>
</pre></div>
<p>The last line with <tt class="docutils literal">AWS_S3_HOST</tt> is really important here as boto - client that
django-storages use underneath to connect to AWS doesn't have default region set up.
If this is not specified I upload files with redirection which don't allow to transfer
static files or upload any large media file.</p>
<p>As I have AWS settings set up there is time to change static files settings in settings.py:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="n">STATICFILES_LOCATION</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s1">'static'</span>
<span class="n">STATIC_URL</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s2">&quot;https://</span><span class="si">%s</span><span class="s2">/</span><span class="si">%s</span><span class="s2">/&quot;</span> <span class="o">%</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="n">AWS_S3_CUSTOM_DOMAIN</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">STATICFILES_LOCATION</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="n">STATICFILES_STORAGE</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s1">'audio_transcoder.storages.StaticStorage'</span>
<span class="n">STATICFILES_DIRS</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="p">(</span>
  <span class="n">os</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">path</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">join</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">BASE_DIR</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">root</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s1">'static'</span><span class="p">),</span>
<span class="p">)</span>
</pre></div>
<p>I add custom <tt class="docutils literal">StaticStorage</tt> as I want my static files to be under static in S3 bucket:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="kn">from</span> <span class="nn">django.conf</span> <span class="kn">import</span> <span class="n">settings</span>
<span class="kn">from</span> <span class="nn">storages.backends.s3boto</span> <span class="kn">import</span> <span class="n">S3BotoStorage</span>


<span class="k">class</span> <span class="nc">StaticStorage</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">S3BotoStorage</span><span class="p">):</span>
  <span class="n">location</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">settings</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">STATICFILES_LOCATION</span>
</pre></div>
<p>To upload my static files I simply run <tt class="docutils literal">python manage.py collectstatic</tt>. After a while
I can see that my files are in a bucket:</p>
<img alt="Static files inside S3" src="https://www.djangoproject.com/images/aws3.png" />
<p>Right now when I run my server I can see the location of my static files:</p>
<img alt="Static files loaded from S3" src="https://www.djangoproject.com/images/aws4.png" />
<p>As static files are working it's high time to use AWS for media files. Right now it's simple - in
settings I add:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="n">MEDIAFILES_LOCATION</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s1">'media'</span>
<span class="n">MEDIA_URL</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s2">&quot;https://</span><span class="si">%s</span><span class="s2">/</span><span class="si">%s</span><span class="s2">/&quot;</span> <span class="o">%</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="n">AWS_S3_CUSTOM_DOMAIN</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">MEDIAFILES_LOCATION</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="n">DEFAULT_FILE_STORAGE</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s1">'audio_transcoder.storages.MediaStorage'</span>
</pre></div>
<p>with custom storage:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="k">class</span> <span class="nc">MediaStorage</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">S3BotoStorage</span><span class="p">):</span>
  <span class="n">location</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">settings</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">MEDIAFILES_LOCATION</span>
</pre></div>
<p>Now when I upload my mp3 file it's sent directly to S3 bucket under media location:</p>

That is, it was on Nov 20, 2006, Greg Taylor made the first repo commit to what would eventually become the Evennia of today. Greg has said that Evennia started out as a "weird experiment" of building a MUD/MUX using Django. The strange name he got from a cheesy NPC in the <a href="https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Evennia" target="_blank">Guild Wars</a> MMORPG and Greg's <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!category-topic/evennia/evennia-news/5hQTspfWd_Q" target="_blank">first post</a> to the mailing list also echoes the experimental intention of the codebase. The merger with Twisted came <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!category-topic/evennia/evennia-news/CJ52R4Ws0OM" target="_blank">pretty early too</a>, replacing the early asyncore hack he used and immediately seeing a massive speedup. Evennia got attention from the MUD community - clearly a Python-based MUD system sounded attractive.<br /><br />When I first joined the project I had been looking at doing something MUD-like in Python for a good while. I had looked over the various existing Python code bases at the time and found them all to be either abandoned or very limited. I had a few week's stunt working with <a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/pymoo/" target="_blank">pymoo</a> before asking myself why I was going through the trouble of parsing a custom script language<i> ... in Python</i> ... Why not use Python throughout? This is when I came upon Evennia. I started <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!category-topic/evennia/evennia-news/yfR0GLKGhJA" target="_blank">making contributions</a> and around 2010 I <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!category-topic/evennia/evennia-news/zXsA2PaWUoU" target="_blank">took over the development</a> as real life commitments forced Greg to step down.<br /><br />Over the years we have gone through a series of changes. We have gone from using SVN to Mercurial and then to using GIT. We have transited from GoogleCode to GitHub - the main problem of which was converting the wiki documentation (Evennia has <a href="https://github.com/evennia/evennia/wiki" target="_blank">extensive documentation</a>). <br /><br />For a long time we used Python's reload() function to add code to the running game. It worked ... sometimes, depending on what you changed. Eventually it turned out to be so unpredictable that we now use two processes, one to connect clients to and the other running the game, meaning we can completely restart one process without disconnecting anyone. <br /><br />Back in the day you were also expected to create your own game in a folder <span>game/</span> inside the Evennia repo itself. It made it really hard for us to update that folder without creating merge conflicts all over. Now Evennia is a proper library and the code you write is properly separated from ours.<br /><br />So in summary, many things have happened over the years, much of it documented in this blog. With 3500 commits, 28 000 lines of code (+46% comments) and some 25 people contributing in the last year, <a href="https://www.openhub.net/p/evennia" target="_blank">Openhub</a> lists us as <br /><br /><blockquote class="tr_bq">"<i>A mature, well-established codebase with a stable commit history, a large development team and very well documented source code</i>".&nbsp;</blockquote><br />It's just words compiled by an algorithm, but they still feel kinda good!<br /><br /><br />While Evennia was always meant to be used for any type of multiplayer text game, this general use have been expanded and cleaned up a lot over the years.<br /><br />This has been reflected in the width of people wanting to use it for different genres: Over time the MUSH people influenced us into adding the option to play the same character from many different clients at the same time (apparently, playing on the bus and then continuing on another device later is common for such games). Others have wanted to use Evennia for interactive fiction, for hack&amp;slash, deep roleplay, strategy, education or just for learning Python.<br /><br />Since Evennia is a framework/library and tries to not impose any particular game systems, it means there is much work to do when building a game using Evennia. The result is that there are dozens of games "in production" using Evennia (and more we probably don't know about), but few public releases yet.<br /><br />The first active "game" may have been an Evennia game/chat supporting the Russian version of 4chan...&nbsp;<span id="goog_1748990486"></span><span id="goog_1748990486">The community driven Evennia demo-game <a href="http://ainneve.evennia.com/" target="_blank">Ainneve</a></span><span id="goog_1748990486"> is also progressing, recently adding combat for testing. This is aimed at offering an example of more game-specific code people can build from (the way Diku does). There are similar projects meant for helping people create RPI (RolePlay Intensive) and MUSH-style games. </span><span id="goog_1748990487"></span>That said, the Evennia-game <a href="http://games.evennia.com/game/arx" target="_blank">Arx, After the Reckoning</a><span id="goog_1748990486"> is progressing through beta at a good clip and is showing all signs of becoming the first full-fledged released Evennia game.</span><span id="goog_1748990486">&nbsp;</span><br /><br /><br /><span id="goog_1748990486">So cheers, Evennia for turning 10. That's enough of the introspection and history. I'll get back to more technical aspects in the next post. </span>

            <h2>Optimizing the construction of Django QuerySets</h2>

        <p class="discreet">
            
                  By Adam’s Tech Blog from Django community aggregator: Community blog posts.
            
            
            
                Published on <span name="publication_time">Nov 29, 2016</span>.
            
        </p>

        <p><img alt="Deep construction
details" src="https://www.djangoproject.com/tech/assets/2016-11-30-construction-underground.jpg" /></p>

<p>Django’s ORM is normally fast enough as-is, but if you’ve ever profiled a high
traffic view with a fairly complicated query, you might have found that
constructing <code>QuerySet</code> can take a noticeable portion of your request time. For
example, I once found a query on the front page of the site I was working on
that took 1ms to construct and 1ms for the database to answer. With a
performance budget of 100ms, that was 1% gone on computing the exactly same
SQL.</p>

<p>Thankfully we don’t need to instantly drop down to raw SQL to optimize such
cases, as Django’s <code>QuerySet</code> API naturally lends itself to caching the
intermediate objects. Since each operation on a <code>QuerySet</code> returns a <em>new</em>
object with the change applied, they’re always lazy as to executing the
SQL, and operations can (normally) be chained in any order, you can build the
non-specific part of your <code>QuerySet</code> up as a cached object and then apply
final, specific filtering required at request time.</p>

<p>Just a note before we dive in: this should be one of the least reached for
tools in your optimization toolbox - normally it’s enough to fix the basics
such as avoiding N+1 queries with <code>select_related()</code> / <code>prefetch_related()</code>,
and adding caching of data between requests with Django’s caching framework. On
that old front page I was talking about, the reason the rest of the page fit in
98ms was because most of it came from a few cache keys, avoiding even some
template rendering.</p>

<p>As an example, let’s say we’re building an autocomplete feature on Django’s
<code>User</code> model. We might have a function that looks like this:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-python"><span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">full_construction_autocomplete</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">typed</span><span class="p">):</span>
    <span class="k">return</span> <span class="n">User</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">objects</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">annotate</span><span class="p">(</span>
        <span class="n">username_length</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="n">Length</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s">'username'</span><span class="p">)</span>
    <span class="p">)</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">order_by</span><span class="p">(</span>
        <span class="s">'username_length'</span>
    <span class="p">)</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">filter</span><span class="p">(</span>
        <span class="n">username__startswith</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="n">typed</span>
    <span class="p">)</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>If we time it with IPython’s <code>%timeit</code> on <code>./manage.py shell</code>, it will time
just the construction time, since nothing is iterating the QuerySet and causing
the lazy fetching of results from the database. It comes out taking about a
quarter of a millisecond on my machine:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-python"><span class="n">In</span> <span class="p">[</span><span class="mi">2</span><span class="p">]:</span> <span class="o">%</span><span class="n">timeit</span> <span class="n">full_construction_autocomplete</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s">'ad'</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="mi">1000</span> <span class="n">loops</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">best</span> <span class="n">of</span> <span class="mi">3</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="mi">263</span> <span class="err">µ</span><span class="n">s</span> <span class="n">per</span> <span class="n">loop</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>To cache most of the construction, we can just define the non-specific part of
the query as a module-level object, and apply the <code>filter()</code> at the last step:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-python"><span class="n">cached_qs</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">User</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">objects</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">annotate</span><span class="p">(</span>
    <span class="n">username_length</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="n">Length</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s">'username'</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="p">)</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">order_by</span><span class="p">(</span>
    <span class="s">'username_length'</span>
<span class="p">)</span>


<span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">cached_construction_autocomplete</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">typed</span><span class="p">):</span>
    <span class="k">return</span> <span class="n">cached_qs</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">filter</span><span class="p">(</span>
        <span class="n">username__startswith</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="n">typed</span>
    <span class="p">)</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>And just like that, we’ve sped the function calls up by more than 50%:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-python"><span class="n">In</span> <span class="p">[</span><span class="mi">4</span><span class="p">]:</span> <span class="o">%</span><span class="n">timeit</span> <span class="n">cached_construction_autocomplete</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s">'ad'</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="mi">10000</span> <span class="n">loops</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">best</span> <span class="n">of</span> <span class="mi">3</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="mi">105</span> <span class="err">µ</span><span class="n">s</span> <span class="n">per</span> <span class="n">loop</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>Obviously 160 microseconds on its own is hardly going to be noticeable to your
end users, but if you find yourself looking at a complicated or frequently
called <code>QuerySet</code>, this technique might help you make your performance budget.
It’s also a simple optimization.</p>

<p>You don’t necessarily have to cache with a module-level object, for example in
<code>ModelAdmin</code> classes you could cache partially constructed <code>QuerySet</code>s on the
class itself. For example this will work as long as you don’t do per-request
modifications in <code>get_queryset</code> or <code>get_ordering</code>:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-python"><span class="k">class</span> <span class="nc">MyModelAdmin</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">ModelAdmin</span><span class="p">):</span>
    <span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">get_queryset</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="bp">self</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">request</span><span class="p">):</span>
        <span class="k">if</span> <span class="ow">not</span> <span class="nb">hasattr</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="bp">self</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s">'_queryset'</span><span class="p">):</span>
            <span class="bp">self</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">_queryset</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="nb">super</span><span class="p">()</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">get_queryset</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">request</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="bp">None</span><span class="p">)</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">annotate</span><span class="p">(</span>
                <span class="n">username_length</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="n">Length</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s">'username'</span><span class="p">),</span>
            <span class="p">)</span>
        <span class="k">return</span> <span class="bp">self</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">_queryset</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">all</span><span class="p">()</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>The <code>all()</code> here is important to make sure we hand a copy of the <code>QuerySet</code> to
the caller and avoid caching the results once for the whole class!</p>

<p>I’m sure you can come up with the right caching scheme for wherever it is you
construct your <code>QuerySet</code>s, such as your class-based views, or custom managers.</p>

<p>The Django core team are aware of the time that can be wasted on <code>QuerySet</code>
construction, and have looked at optimizing it. This would be particularly
useful for some Django internals, such as when constructing a <code>QuerySet</code>
during <code>Model.save()</code>. Anssi Kääriäinen created a patch to add an option to
<code>QuerySet</code>s to not clone themselves on operations in
<a href="https://code.djangoproject.com/ticket/20880">Ticket 20880</a>, and Josh Smeaton
opened an experimental
<a href="https://github.com/django/django/pull/7505">Pull Request</a> implementing the
same idea as a (maybe) public API. I personally think that it’s going to be
better kept as a private API for Django’s core, as there are many ways of
optimizing user code, including this strategy of caching partially constructed
<code>QuerySet</code>s :)</p>

<p>Django core developers and Caktus Technical Manager <a href="https://www.caktusgroup.com/about/karen-tracey/">Karen Tracey</a> and CEO/Co-founder <a href="https://www.caktusgroup.com/about/tobias-mcnulty/">Tobias McNulty</a> both flew to Amsterdam to spend time with fellow Djangonauts.  Since not all of us could go, we wanted to ask them what Django Under the Hood was like.</p>
<h2>Can you tell us more about Django Under the Hood?</h2>
<p><strong>Tobias</strong>: This was my first Django Under the Hood. The venue was packed. It’s an in-depth, curated talk series by invite-only speakers.  It was impeccably organized. Everything is thought through. They even have little spots where you can pick up toothbrush and toothpaste.</p>
<p><strong>Karen</strong>: I’ve been to all three. They sell out very quickly. Core developers are all invited, get tickets, and some funding depending on sponsorship. This is the only event where some costs are covered for core developers. DjangoCon EU and US have core devs going, but they attend it however they manage to get funds for it.</p>
<h2>What was your favorite part of Django Under the Hood?</h2>
<p><strong>Tobias</strong>: The talks: they’re longer and more detailed than typical conference talks; they’re curated and confined to a single track so the conference has a natural rhythm to it. I really liked the talks, but also being there with the core team. Just being able to meet these people you see on IRC and mailing list, there’s a big value to that. I was able to put people in context. I’d met quite a few of the core team before but not all.</p>
<p><strong>Karen</strong>:  I don’t have much time to contribute to Django because of heavy involvement in cat rescue locally and a full time job, but this is a great opportunity to have at least a day to do Django stuff at the sprint and to see a lot of people I don’t otherwise have a chance to see.</p>
<h2>All the talk videos are now online. Which talk do you recommend we watch first?</h2>
<p><strong>Karen</strong>: Depends on what you’re interested in. I really enjoyed the <a href="https://youtu.be/lx5WQjXLlq8?list=PLQdy7QUATciZ4V3g3iCTnG5fvkZkuNGyg">Instagram one</a>. As someone who contributed to the Django framework, to see it used and scaled to the size of Instagram 500 million plus users is interesting.</p>
<p><strong>Tobias</strong>: There were humorous insights, like the Justin Bieber effect. Originally they’d shared their database by user ID, so everybody on the ops team had memorized his user ID to be prepared in case he posted anything. At that scale, maximizing the number of requests they can serve from a single server really matters.</p>
<p><strong>Karen</strong>: All the monitoring was interesting too.</p>
<p><strong>Tobias</strong>: I liked Ana Balica’s <a href="https://youtu.be/EHyKzPQFXzo?list=PLQdy7QUATciZ4V3g3iCTnG5fvkZkuNGyg">testing talk</a>. It included a history of testing in Django, which was educational to me. Django didn’t start with a framework for testing your applications. It was added as a ticket in the low thousands. She also had practical advice on how to treat your test suite as part of the application, like splitting out functional tests and unit tests. She had good strategies to make your unit tests as fast as possible so you can run them as often as needed. </p>
<h2>What was your favorite tip or lesson?</h2>
<p><strong>Tobias</strong>: Jennifer Akullian gave a keynote on mental health that had a diagram of how to talk about feelings in a team. You try to dig into what that means. She talked about trying to destigmatize mental health in tech. I think that’s an important topic we should be discussing more.</p>
<p><strong>Karen</strong>: I learned things in each of the talks. I have a hard time picking out one tip that sticks with me. I’d like to look into what Ana Balica said about mutation testing and learn more about it. </p>
<h2>What are some trends you’re seeing in Django?</h2>
<p><strong>Karen</strong>: The core developers met for a half-day meeting the first day of the conference. We talked about what’s going on with DJango, what’s happened in the past year, what’s the future of Django. The theme was “Django is boring.”</p>
<p><strong>Tobias</strong>: “Django is boring” because it is no longer unknown. It’s an established, common framework now used by big organizations like NASA, Instagram, Pinterest, US Senate, etc. At the start, it was a little known bootstrappy cutting edge web framework. The reasons why we hooked up with Django nine years ago at Caktus, like security and business efficacy, all of those arguments are ever so much stronger today. That can make it seem boring for developers but it’s a good thing for business.</p>
<p><strong>Karen</strong>: It’s been around for awhile. Eleven years. A lot of the common challenges in Django have been solved. Not that there aren’t cutting edge web problems. But should you solve some problems elsewhere? For example, in third party, reusable apps like channels, REST framework.</p>
<p><strong>Tobias</strong>: There was also recognition that Django is so much more than the software. It’s  the community and all the packages around it. That’s what make Dango great. </p>
<h2>Where do you see Django going in the future?</h2>
<p><strong>Karen</strong>: I hate those sorts of  questions. I don’t know how to answer that. It’s been fun to see the Django community grow and I expect to see continued growth.</p>
<p><strong>Tobias</strong>: That’s not my favorite question either. But Django has a role in fostering and continuing to grow the community it has. Django can set an example for open source communities on how to operate and fund themselves in sustainable ways. Django is experimenting with funding right now. How do we make open source projects like this sustainable without relying on people with full-time jobs volunteering their nights and weekends? This is definitely not a “solved problem,” and I look forward to seeing the progress Django and other open source communities make in the coming years.</p>
<h2>Thank you to Tobias and Karen for sharing their thoughts.</h2>

        </a>

        <p class="discreet">
            
                  By David Fozo's Blog from Django community aggregator: Community blog posts.
            
            
            
                Published on <span name="publication_time">Nov 29, 2016</span>.
            
        </p>

        <p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%;">In this part of the tutorial, I will show you some basic model definition by creating a simple blog. As discussed earlier, database tables are translated from the models.py files.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%;"> </p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%;">If you haven't followed along with earlier tutorials, you can do the setup <a href="http://www.davidfozo.com/blog/django-tutorial-setup/" target="_blank">here</a>. Choose branch exercise4.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%;"> </p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%;">As usual we start by creating a new branch:</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%;"><code>git checkout -b blog</code></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%;"> </p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%;">Activate virtualenv, if you haven't already:</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%;"><code>source ../virtualenv/bin/activate</code></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%;"> </p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%;">A is an application by itself, so we create one inside Django with the following command.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%;"><code>python3 manage.py startapp blog</code></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%;"> </p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%;">You should see these directories and files in your source dir:</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%;"><code>blog/</code></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%;"><code>main/</code></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%;"><code>manage.py</code></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%;"><code>MyTutorial/</code></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%;"><code>requirements.txt</code></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%;"> </p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%;">In order for django to discover the new application, you need to include it in the installed apps in settings.py</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%;">***MyTutorial/settings.py***</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%;">...</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%;"><code>INSTALLED_APPS = [</code></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%;"><code>    'main',</code></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%;"><code>    'blog',</code></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%;"><code>    'django.contrib.admin',</code></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%;"><code>    'django.contrib.auth',</code></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%;"><code>    'django.contrib.contenttypes',</code></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%;"><code>    'django.contrib.sessions',</code></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%;"><code>    'django.contrib.messages',</code></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%;"><code>    'django.contrib.staticfiles',</code></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%;"><code>]</code></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%;">…</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%;"></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%;">As usual we write some tests first. If you have a look at the other test file main/tests.py you can see, that we have some very similar goal here. It might be tempting to import those tests and tweak it a little, but that wouldn't be right. As for Unit Tests, it needs to be completely independent from each other. So it is not a problem, if they look too much alike.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%;"> </p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%;">***blog/tests.py***</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%;">from django.core.urlresolvers import resolve</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%;">from django.test import TestCase</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%;">from django.http import HttpRequest</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%;">from blog.models import BlogPost</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%;">from blog.views import view_post</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%;"> </p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%;"># Create your tests here.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%;">class BlogPostTest(TestCase):</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%;"> </p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%;">    def setUp(self):</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%;">        self.title = "Blog Post Test"</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%;">        self.slug = "blog-post-test"</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%;">        self.body = "This is a test."</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%;">        self.date = "2016-11-26"</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%;"> </p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%;">        BlogPost.objects.create(</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%;">            title=self.title,</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%;">            slug=self.slug,</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%;">            body=self.body,</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%;">            date=self.date)</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%;"> </p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%;">    def test_blogpost_resolves_to_slug(self):</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%;">        blogpost = resolve('/blog/' + self.slug + '/')</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%;">        self.assertEqual(blogpost.func,view_post)</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%;"> </p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%;">    def test_blogpost_displays_article(self):</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%;"> </p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%;">         request = HttpRequest()</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%;">         response = view_post(request,self.slug)</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%;">         self.assertTrue(response.content.startswith(b'&lt;!doctype html&gt;'))</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%;">         for i in [self.title,self.body]:</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%;">             self.assertIn(i,response.content.decode())</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%;"></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%;">    def tearDown(self):</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%;">        BlogPost.objects.all().filter(title=self.title).delete()</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%;"> </p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%; text-align: justify;">So what did we do here? We created a new test class, which tests our blog application. In the setUp function, we create some title, body, slug variables, which we can refer to later. We also a create BlogPost object. In the first test we check if our custom url will trigger the right view function. I think the second tests title speaks for itself. We call the view_post function, which we will create in a moment, with our custom slug (the blog post identifier as in the URL). Then check if the response contains our chosen title, and body.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%;"> </p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%;">If you run the tests now:</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%;">python3 manage.py test</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%;"> </p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%;">You should have two failures:</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%;">FF.......</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%;"> </p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%;">So let's create the model classes first, because that's the most interesting.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%;"> </p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%;">***blog/models.py***</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%;">from django.db import models</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%;">from django.core.urlresolvers import reverse</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%;">from django.template.defaultfilters import slugify</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%;"> </p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%;"># Create your models here.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%;">class BlogPost(models.Model):</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%;">    title = models.CharField(max_length=255)</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%;">    slug = models.SlugField(max_length=255)</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%;">    body = models.TextField()</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%;">    date = models.DateField(auto_now_add=True)</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%;"> </p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%;">    def save(self, *args, **kwargs):</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%;">        if not self.id:</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%;">            self.slug = slugify(self.title)</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%;">        super(BlogPost, self).save(*args, **kwargs)</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%;"></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%;">    def get_absolute_url(self):</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%;">        return reverse('blog.views.view_post', args=[str(self.slug)])</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%;"> </p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%; text-align: justify;">What is happening here? So our database tables are model classes in Django. The fields are variables. So you declare a variable, and that will be the title of the database column/field. Then, you choose the appropriate field type. One if the method is saving your title as a slug (url) if it's a new post (no id yet), the other method let's you reference this post as an url.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%;"> </p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%;">Now, let's connect these models to the templates, by the views functions.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%;"> </p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%;">***blog/views.py***</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%;">from django.shortcuts import render_to_response, get_object_or_404</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%;">from blog.models import BlogPost</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%;"> </p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%;"> </p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%;"># Create your views here.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%;">def view_post(request, slug):</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%;">    post = get_object_or_404(BlogPost, slug=slug)</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%;">    return render_to_response("blogpost.html", {'post' : post,})</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%;"> </p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%;">Okay, so our view_post function takes in the slug and fetches the corresponding BlogPost model object. Then it renders the blogpost.html template, where the post variables refer to our BlogPost object.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%;"> </p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%;">Let's add our BlogPost slug to the urls:</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%;">***MyTutorial/urls.py***</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%;">from django.conf.urls import url</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%;">from django.contrib import admin</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%;">from main.views import home, form, subscribed, thanks</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%;">from blog.views import view_post</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%;"> </p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%;">urlpatterns = [</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%;">    url(r'^admin/', admin.site.urls),</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%;">    url(r'^form/',form),</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%;">    url(r'^thanks/',thanks),</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%;">    url(r'^subscribed/',subscribed),</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%;">    url(r'^$', home),</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%;">    url(r'^blog/(?P&lt;slug&gt;[-\w\d\_]+)/$', view_post, name='view_post'),</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%;">]</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%;"> </p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%;">So now you can reference your Post as /blog/my-blog-post-title.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%;"> </p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%;">Let's create some basic template. See, how it all comes full circle!</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%;">***blog/blogpost.html***</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%;">&lt;!doctype html&gt;</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%;">&lt;html&gt;</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%;">&lt;head&gt;</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%;">    &lt;title&gt;{{ post.title }}&lt;/title&gt;</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%;">&lt;/head&gt;</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%;">&lt;body&gt;</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%;">    &lt;h1&gt;{{ post.title }}&lt;/h1&gt;</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%;">    &lt;p&gt;{{ post.body }}&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%;">    &lt;br&gt;</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%;">    &lt;p&gt;created at {{ post.date }}&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%;">&lt;/body&gt;</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%;">&lt;/html&gt;</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%;"> </p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%;">If you run the tests, you will still have no luck. Even though, every piece of code is in place. You need to update the database to reflect the changes.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%;">python3 manage.py makemigrations</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%;">python3 manage.py migrate</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%;"> </p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%;">Now, if want to make a blog post, it's not so convenient:</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%;">python3 manage.py shell</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%;">&gt;&gt;&gt;from blog.models import BlogPost</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%;">&gt;&gt;&gt;BlogPost.objects.create(title=”My Title”,slug=”my-title”,body=”Hello World”,date=”2016-11-29”)</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%;">&gt;&gt;&gt;exit()</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%;"> </p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%;">So you are able to see it, if you start up your development server:</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%;">python3 manage.py runserver</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%;"> </p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%;">Write to the url line in the browser: <a href="http://localhost/blog/my-title/">http://localhost/blog/my-title/</a> . Should see this:</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%;">### Screenshot ###</p>

        <p>Don&#8217;t worry, this isn&#8217;t another piece about Python 3. I&#8217;m fully in favor of Python 3, and <a href="https://www.djangoproject.com/weblog/2016/jun/10/python-3-again/">on record as to why</a>. And if you&#8217;re still not convinced, I suggest <a href="https://eev.ee/blog/2016/07/31/python-faq-why-should-i-use-python-3/">this thoroughly comprehensive article on the topic</a>, which goes over not just the bits people get angry about but also the frankly <em>massive</em> amount of cool stuff that only works in Python 3, and that you&#8217;re missing out on if you still only use Python&nbsp;2 ...</p>

        <p>Filtering QuerySets dynamically is a fairly common use case. Sure thing there is a pluggable app to make your life
easier. This tutorial is about how to use the <strong>django-filter</strong> app to add a hassle-free filtering to your views.
To illustrate this tutorial I will implement a view to search for users. As usual the code used in this tutorial is
available on GitHub. You can find the link in the end of this post.</p>

<hr />

<h4 id="installation">Installation</h4>

<p>Easiest way is to install it with pip:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-bash">pip install django-filter</code></pre></figure>

<p>That’s it. It’s ready to be used. Make sure you update your <strong>requirements.txt</strong>.</p>

<p>The default language of the app is English. It already come with some localization and language support. Currently the
supported languages are: de, es_AR, fr, pl, ru, zh_CN. Unless you want to use any of those languages in your project,
you don’t need to add <code class="highlighter-rouge">django_filter</code> to the <code class="highlighter-rouge">INSTALLED_APPS</code>.</p>

<hr />

<h4 id="usage">Usage</h4>

<p>Create a file named <strong>filters.py</strong> inside your app folder:</p>

<p><strong>filters.py</strong></p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-python"><span class="kn">from</span> <span class="nn">django.contrib.auth.models</span> <span class="kn">import</span> <span class="n">User</span>
<span class="kn">import</span> <span class="nn">django_filters</span>

<span class="k">class</span> <span class="nc">UserFilter</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">django_filters</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">FilterSet</span><span class="p">):</span>
    <span class="k">class</span> <span class="nc">Meta</span><span class="p">:</span>
        <span class="n">model</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">User</span>
        <span class="n">fields</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="p">[</span><span class="s">'username'</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s">'first_name'</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s">'last_name'</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="p">]</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>The view is as simple as:</p>

<p><strong>views.py</strong></p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-python"><span class="kn">from</span> <span class="nn">django.contrib.auth.models</span> <span class="kn">import</span> <span class="n">User</span>
<span class="kn">from</span> <span class="nn">django.shortcuts</span> <span class="kn">import</span> <span class="n">render</span>
<span class="kn">from</span> <span class="nn">.filters</span> <span class="kn">import</span> <span class="n">UserFilter</span>

<span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">search</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">request</span><span class="p">):</span>
    <span class="n">user_list</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">User</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">objects</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="nb">all</span><span class="p">()</span>
    <span class="n">user_filter</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">UserFilter</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">request</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">GET</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">queryset</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="n">user_list</span><span class="p">)</span>
    <span class="k">return</span> <span class="n">render</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">request</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s">'search/user_list.html'</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="p">{</span><span class="s">'filter'</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="n">user_filter</span><span class="p">})</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>Then a route:</p>

<p><strong>urls.py</strong></p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-python"><span class="kn">from</span> <span class="nn">django.conf.urls</span> <span class="kn">import</span> <span class="n">url</span>
<span class="kn">from</span> <span class="nn">mysite.search</span> <span class="kn">import</span> <span class="n">views</span>

<span class="n">urlpatterns</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="p">[</span>
    <span class="n">url</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s">r'^search/$'</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">views</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">search</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">name</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s">'search'</span><span class="p">),</span>
<span class="p">]</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>And finally the template:</p>

<p><strong>user_list.html</strong></p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-django"><span class="cp">{%</span> <span class="k">extends</span> <span class="s1">'base.html'</span> <span class="cp">%}</span>

<span class="cp">{%</span> <span class="k">block</span> <span class="nv">content</span> <span class="cp">%}</span>
  <span class="nt">&lt;form</span> <span class="na">method=</span><span class="s">"get"</span><span class="nt">&gt;</span>
    <span class="cp">{{</span> <span class="nv">filter.form.as_p</span> <span class="cp">}}</span>
    <span class="nt">&lt;button</span> <span class="na">type=</span><span class="s">"submit"</span><span class="nt">&gt;</span>Search<span class="nt">&lt;/button&gt;</span>
  <span class="nt">&lt;/form&gt;</span>
  <span class="nt">&lt;ul&gt;</span>
  <span class="cp">{%</span> <span class="k">for</span> <span class="nv">user</span> <span class="ow">in</span> <span class="nv">filter.qs</span> <span class="cp">%}</span>
    <span class="nt">&lt;li&gt;</span><span class="cp">{{</span> <span class="nv">user.username</span> <span class="cp">}}</span> - <span class="cp">{{</span> <span class="nv">user.get_full_name</span> <span class="cp">}}</span><span class="nt">&lt;/li&gt;</span>
  <span class="cp">{%</span> <span class="k">endfor</span> <span class="cp">%}</span>
  <span class="nt">&lt;/ul&gt;</span>
<span class="cp">{%</span> <span class="k">endblock</span> <span class="cp">%}</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>The magic happens inside the <code class="highlighter-rouge">UserFilter</code> class. We simply have to pass the <code class="highlighter-rouge">request.GET</code> data to the <code class="highlighter-rouge">UserFilter</code>
class, along with the QuerySet we want to filter. It will generate a Django Form with the search fields as well as
return the filtered QuerySet.</p>

<p>So basically we will be working inside the UserFilter definition and the HTML template, displaying properly the data.</p>

<p>This is what the initial example looks like:</p>

<p><img alt="Django Filter" src="https://www.djangoproject.com/media/2016/11/filter1.png" /></p>

<p>And after submitting the form:</p>

<p><img alt="Django Filter" src="https://www.djangoproject.com/media/2016/11/filter2.png" /></p>

<hr />

<h4 id="using-the-generic-class-based-view">Using The Generic Class-Based View</h4>

<p>If you won’t be doing anything special inside the view function, you can easily replace it with the
<strong>django-filter</strong>’s generic class-based view.</p>

<p>You may either pass a <strong>model</strong> or a <strong>filterset_class</strong> as a parameter. We will be working with the
<strong>filterset_class</strong>, so to give us more flexibility:</p>

<p><strong>urls.py</strong></p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-python"><span class="kn">from</span> <span class="nn">django.conf.urls</span> <span class="kn">import</span> <span class="n">url</span>
<span class="kn">from</span> <span class="nn">django_filters.views</span> <span class="kn">import</span> <span class="n">FilterView</span>
<span class="kn">from</span> <span class="nn">mysite.search.filters</span> <span class="kn">import</span> <span class="n">UserFilter</span>

<span class="n">urlpatterns</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="p">[</span>
    <span class="n">url</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s">r'^search/$'</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">FilterView</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">as_view</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">filterset_class</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="n">UserFilter</span><span class="p">,</span>
        <span class="n">template_name</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s">'search/user_list.html'</span><span class="p">),</span> <span class="n">name</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s">'search'</span><span class="p">),</span>
<span class="p">]</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>Note that I also passed the <strong>template_name</strong> as a parameter. By default <strong>django-filter</strong> will look for the template
based on the model’s app and its name, following the logic: <code class="highlighter-rouge">&lt;app_name&gt;/&lt;model_name&gt;_filter.html</code>.</p>

<p>Since I’m implementing a filter for the Django User, which lives inside the auth app (and I don’t have access to it),
the <strong>django-filter</strong> library would look for a template in the path: <code class="highlighter-rouge">auth/user_filter.html</code>.</p>

<hr />

<h4 id="exploring-the-filtering-options">Exploring the Filtering Options</h4>

<p>It is very straightforward to use the filters. Basically it use the <a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/ref/models/querysets/#field-lookups" target="_blank">Django’s QuerySet field lookup</a>.</p>

<p>So, let’s say we want to filter the <code class="highlighter-rouge">first_name</code>, and the input should be case-insensitive and it may match part of
the name.</p>

<p><strong>filters.py</strong></p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-python"><span class="k">class</span> <span class="nc">UserFilter</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">django_filters</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">FilterSet</span><span class="p">):</span>
    <span class="n">first_name</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">django_filters</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">CharFilter</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">lookup_expr</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s">'icontains'</span><span class="p">)</span>
    <span class="k">class</span> <span class="nc">Meta</span><span class="p">:</span>
        <span class="n">model</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">User</span>
        <span class="n">fields</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="p">[</span><span class="s">'username'</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s">'first_name'</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s">'last_name'</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="p">]</span></code></pre></figure>

<p><img alt="Django Filter" src="https://www.djangoproject.com/media/2016/11/filter3.png" /></p>

<p>We may also add the <code class="highlighter-rouge">date_joined</code> field, and filter it by the year only:</p>

<p><strong>filters.py</strong></p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-python"><span class="k">class</span> <span class="nc">UserFilter</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">django_filters</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">FilterSet</span><span class="p">):</span>
    <span class="n">first_name</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">django_filters</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">CharFilter</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">lookup_expr</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s">'icontains'</span><span class="p">)</span>
    <span class="n">year_joined</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">django_filters</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">NumberFilter</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">name</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s">'date_joined'</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">lookup_expr</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s">'year'</span><span class="p">)</span>
    <span class="k">class</span> <span class="nc">Meta</span><span class="p">:</span>
        <span class="n">model</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">User</span>
        <span class="n">fields</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="p">[</span><span class="s">'username'</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s">'first_name'</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s">'last_name'</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="p">]</span></code></pre></figure>

<p><img alt="Django Filter" src="https://www.djangoproject.com/media/2016/11/filter4.png" /></p>

<p>Note that I didn’t added it to the <code class="highlighter-rouge">fields</code> list. If you are defining it as a class attribute, you don’t need to
explicitly add it to the <code class="highlighter-rouge">Meta</code> class.</p>

<p>We may also add some extra attributes, related to the year:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-python"><span class="k">class</span> <span class="nc">UserFilter</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">django_filters</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">FilterSet</span><span class="p">):</span>
    <span class="n">first_name</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">django_filters</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">CharFilter</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">lookup_expr</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s">'icontains'</span><span class="p">)</span>

    <span class="k">class</span> <span class="nc">Meta</span><span class="p">:</span>
        <span class="n">model</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">User</span>
        <span class="n">fields</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="p">[</span><span class="s">'username'</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s">'first_name'</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s">'last_name'</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="p">]</span></code></pre></figure>

<p><img alt="Django Filter" src="https://www.djangoproject.com/media/2016/11/filter5.png" /></p>

<p>Another option is to define the fields as a dictionary:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-python"><span class="k">class</span> <span class="nc">UserFilter</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">django_filters</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">FilterSet</span><span class="p">):</span>
    <span class="k">class</span> <span class="nc">Meta</span><span class="p">:</span>
        <span class="n">model</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">User</span>
        <span class="n">fields</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="p">{</span>
            <span class="s">'username'</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="p">[</span><span class="s">'exact'</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="p">],</span>
            <span class="s">'first_name'</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="p">[</span><span class="s">'icontains'</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="p">],</span>
            <span class="s">'last_name'</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="p">[</span><span class="s">'exact'</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="p">],</span>
            <span class="s">'date_joined'</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="p">[</span><span class="s">'year'</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s">'year__gt'</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s">'year__lt'</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="p">],</span>
        <span class="p">}</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>Works fine with <code class="highlighter-rouge">ManyToManyField</code> too:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-python"><span class="k">class</span> <span class="nc">UserFilter</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">django_filters</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">FilterSet</span><span class="p">):</span>

    <span class="n">year_joined</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">django_filters</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">NumberFilter</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">name</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s">'date_joined'</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">lookup_expr</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s">'year'</span><span class="p">)</span>

    <span class="k">class</span> <span class="nc">Meta</span><span class="p">:</span>
        <span class="n">model</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">User</span>
        <span class="n">fields</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="p">[</span><span class="s">'username'</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s">'first_name'</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s">'last_name'</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s">'year_joined'</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s">'groups'</span><span class="p">]</span></code></pre></figure>

<p><img alt="Django Filter" src="https://www.djangoproject.com/media/2016/11/filter6.png" /></p>

<p>We may also override the default widget for the <code class="highlighter-rouge">ManyToManyField</code> <code class="highlighter-rouge">groups</code> field, using checkbox instead:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-python"><span class="kn">from</span> <span class="nn">django</span> <span class="kn">import</span> <span class="n">forms</span>

        </a>

        <p class="discreet">
            
                  By Abu Ashraf Masnun from Django community aggregator: Community blog posts.
            
            
            
                Published on <span name="publication_time">Nov 26, 2016</span>.
            
        </p>

        <p>In my earlier blog post - <a href="http://masnun.rocks/2016/09/25/introduction-to-django-channels/">Introduction to Django Channels</a>,
I mentioned that we can create our own channels for various purposes. In this blog post, we would discuss where custom channels
can be useful, what could be the challenges and of course we would see some code examples. But before we begin, please make sure
you are familiar with the concepts of Django Channels. I would recommend going through the above mentioned post and the official
docs to familiarize yourself with the basics.</p>

<h3 id="our-use-case">Our Use Case</h3>

<p>Channels is just a queue which has consumers (workers) listenning to it. With that concept in mind, we might be able to think of
many innovative use cases a queue could have. But in our example, we will keep the idea simple. We are going to use Channels as
a means of background task processing.</p>

<p>We will create our own channels for different tasks. There will be consumers waiting for messages on these channels. When we want to
do something in the background, we would pass it on the appropriate channels &amp; the workers will take care of the tasks. For example,
we want to create a thumbnail of an user uploaded photo? We pass it to the <code>thumbnails</code> channel. We want to send a confirmation email,
we send it to the <code>welcome_email</code> channel. Like that. If you are familiar with Celery or Python RQ, this would sound pretty
familiar to you.</p>

<p>Now here&rsquo;s my use case - in one of the projects I am working on, we&rsquo;re building APIs for mobile applications. We use BrainTree for
payment integration. The mobile application sends a <code>nonce</code> - it&rsquo;s like a token that we can use to initiate the actual transaction.
The transaction has two steps - first we initiate it using the nonce and I get back a transaction id. Then I query whether the transaction
succeeded or failed. I felt it would be a good idea to process this in the background. We already have a websocket end point implemented
using Channels. So I thought it would be great to leverage the existing setup instead of introducing something new in the stack.</p>

<h3 id="challenges">Challenges</h3>

<p>It has so far worked pretty well. But we have to remember that Channels does not gurantee delivery of the messages and there is
no retrying if a message fails. So we wrote a custom management command that checks the orders for any records that have the nonce
set but no transaction id or there is transaction id but there is no final result stored. We then scheduled this command to run at
a certain interval and queue up the unfinished/incomplete orders again. In our case, it doesn&rsquo;t hurt if the orders need some 5 to 10
minutes to process.</p>

<p>But if we were working on a product where the message delivery was time critical for our business, we probably would have considered
Celery for the background processing part.</p>

<h3 id="let-s-see-the-codes">Let&rsquo;s see the codes!</h3>

<p>First we needed to write a handler. The hadler would receive the messages on the subscribed channel and process them. Here&rsquo;s the handler:</p>

<pre><code class="language-python">def braintree_process(message):
    order_data = message.content.get('order')
    order_id = message.content.get('order_id')
    order_instance = Order.objects.get(pk=order_id)

    if order_data:
        nonce = order_data.get(&quot;braintree_nonce&quot;)
        if nonce:
            # [snipped]

            TRANSACTION_SUCCESS_STATUSES = [
                braintree.Transaction.Status.Authorized,
                braintree.Transaction.Status.Authorizing,
                braintree.Transaction.Status.Settled,
                braintree.Transaction.Status.SettlementConfirmed,
                braintree.Transaction.Status.SettlementPending,
                braintree.Transaction.Status.Settling,
                braintree.Transaction.Status.SubmittedForSettlement
            ]

            result = braintree.Transaction.sale({
                'amount': str(order_data.get('total')),
                'payment_method_nonce': nonce,
                'options': {
                    &quot;submit_for_settlement&quot;: True
                }
            })

            if result.is_success or result.transaction:
                transaction = braintree.Transaction.find(result.transaction.id)
                if transaction.status in TRANSACTION_SUCCESS_STATUSES:
                    # [snipped]
                else:
                    # [snipped]
            else:
                errors = []
                for x in result.errors.deep_errors:
                    errors.append(str(x.code))

                # [snipped]
</code></pre>

<p>Then we needed to define a routing so the messages on a certain channel is passed on to this handler. So in our channel routing, we added
this:</p>

<pre><code class="language-python">from channels.routing import route
from .channel_handlers import braintree_process

channel_routing = [
    route(&quot;braintree_process&quot;, braintree_process),
    # [snipped] ...
]

</code></pre>

<p>We now have a routing set and a handler ready to accept messages. So we&rsquo;re ready! All we need to do is to start passing the
data to this channel.</p>

<p>When the API receives a <code>nonce</code>, it just passes the order details to this channel:</p>

<pre><code class="language-python">Channel(&quot;braintree_process&quot;).send({
    &quot;order&quot;: data,
    &quot;order_id&quot;: order.id
})
</code></pre>

<p>And then the workers start working. They accept the message and then starts processing the payment request.</p>

<p>In our case, we already had the workers running (since they were serving our websocket requests). If you don&rsquo;t have any workers running,
don&rsquo;t forget to run them.</p>

<pre><code>python manage.py runworker
</code></pre>

<p>If you are wondering about how to deploy channels, I have you covered - <a href="http://masnun.rocks/2016/11/02/deploying-django-channels-using-daphne/">Deploying Django Channels using Daphne</a></p>

<h3 id="prioritizing-scaling-channels">Prioritizing / Scaling Channels</h3>

<p>In our project, Django Channels do two things - handling websocket connections for realtime communication, process delayed jobs in
background. As you can probably guess, the realtime part is more important. In our current setup, the running workers handle both
types of requests as they come. But we want to dedicate more workers to the websocket and perhaps just one worker should keep processing
the payments.</p>

<p>Luckily, we can limit our workers to certain channels using the <code>--only-channels</code> flag. Or alternatively we can exclude certain
channels by using the <code>--exclude-channels</code> flags.</p>

<h3 id="concluding-thoughts">Concluding Thoughts</h3>

<p>I personally find the design of channels very straightforward, simple and easy to reason about. When Channels get merged into Django,
it&rsquo;s going to be quite useful, not just for implementing http/2 or websockets, but also as a way to process background tasks with ease
and without introducing third party libraries.</p>

        <p>There are several ways to extend the the default Django User model. Perhaps one of the most common way (and also less
intrusive) is to extend the User model using a one-to-one link. This strategy is also known as User Profile. One of
the challenges of this particular strategy, if you are using Django Admin, is how to display the profile data in the
User edit page. And that’s what this tutorial is about.</p>

<hr />

<h4 id="background">Background</h4>

<p>I’ve published a while ago an article about <a href="https://www.djangoproject.com/tutorial/2016/07/22/how-to-extend-django-user-model.html">How to Extend Django User Model</a>,
describing in great detail all the different strategies. If you are still not familiar with it, I strongly suggest that
you have a look in this article.</p>

<p>This tutorial is about the User Profile strategy. So, consider we have an app named <strong>core</strong> with the following model
definition:</p>

<p>What we want to achieve is making the fields <strong>location</strong>, <strong>birthdate</strong> and <strong>role</strong> available to be edited on Django
Admin.</p>

<h4 id="editing-the-user-profile">Editing The User Profile</h4>

<p>The trick is very simple. We will extend the default <code class="highlighter-rouge">UserAdmin</code>, add the profile instance as an <strong>inline</strong> and switch
the <code class="highlighter-rouge">UserAdmin</code> Django uses.</p>

<p><strong>admin.py</strong></p>

<p>A few things here: I intentionally defined the <strong>verbose_name_plural</strong> as <strong>Profile</strong>, because each user can have only
one profile, and as the component we are using is an <code class="highlighter-rouge">StackedInline</code> (which normally is used for formsets), just to
avoid displaying <strong>Profiles</strong> in plural when we only have one profile. It’s just a minor thing.</p>

<p>Then a very important thing, we need to override the <code class="highlighter-rouge">get_inline_instances</code> method, so to display the inlines <em>only</em>
in the edit form. Otherwise we might get some problems because of how the Signals work. Remember that the Signal is
responsible for creating the Profile instance.</p>

<p>Since by default Django only provides <strong>username</strong> and <strong>password</strong> upon user creation, this way we keep the default
behavior.</p>

<p>Finally we <strong>unregister</strong> the old User admin and register the new one, the custom with the Profile model.</p>

<p>It will look like this:</p>

<p><img alt="Django Admin User Profile" src="https://www.djangoproject.com/media/2016/11/profile1.png" /></p>

<p>Cool, right? It just works.</p>

<hr />

<h4 id="adding-profile-fields-to-list-view">Adding Profile Fields to List View</h4>

<p>Now what if we want to display the User location (which is defined inside the profile model), in the list view, like
this:</p>

<p><img alt="Django Admin User Profile" src="https://www.djangoproject.com/media/2016/11/profile2.png" /></p>

<p>Since we are already extending the <code class="highlighter-rouge">UserAdmin</code>, it’s just a matter of overriding the <code class="highlighter-rouge">list_display</code> attribute.</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-python"><span class="k">class</span> <span class="nc">CustomUserAdmin</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">UserAdmin</span><span class="p">):</span>

<p>We have to define an extra method, <code class="highlighter-rouge">get_location</code> and append it to the <code class="highlighter-rouge">list_display</code>, because the field is defined in
a external model (the relationship is defined in the Profile model, not in the User model). So for the Django Admin
understand how to display the location attribute, we have to play it this way.</p>

<p>The <code class="highlighter-rouge">get_location.short_description</code> is just to display it prettier in the table header. Otherwise Django Admin would
display it as “Get Location” (which is the name of the method).</p>

<p>A very important detail: note the <code class="highlighter-rouge">list_select_related</code>. We are adding the <strong>profile</strong> relationship there, so to avoid
firing hundreds of unnecessary queries in the database. For more on that subject, check this post:

<h4 id="conclusions">Conclusions</h4>

<p>That’s it! Plain simple. This also open an opportunity to explore more the User model in Django Admin. You can override
several attributes and very easily add new list actions for example.</p>

<p>Django’s documentation is awesome. But even better is to explore its the source code. For example, to understand more
on the definitions of the <code class="highlighter-rouge">UserAdmin</code>, don’t be afraid to explore the source code and see the class’ attributes and
methods: <a href="https://github.com/django/django/blob/master/django/contrib/auth/admin.py#L44" target="_blank">django.contrib.auth.admin</a>.</p>

<p>Also the source code I used in this tutorial is available on GitHub: <a href="https://github.com/sibtc/django-admin-user-profile" target="_blank">sibtc/django-admin-user-profile</a>.</p>

        <p>In this tutorial I will guide you through the steps to implement an AJAX multiple file upload with Django using jQuery.
For this tutorial we will be using a specific plug-in called jQuery File Upload, which takes care of the server
communication using AJAX and also the compatibility with different browsers.</p>

<p>The plug-in is great, but it have so many features that sometimes it can become challenging for some to get started.
You will notice that some of the examples are a little bit redundant, repeating code and so on. That’s on purpose,
so to avoid code abstraction and the examples become more clear.</p>

<p>In the end of this post you will also find the link to download all the code used in this tutorial.</p>

<hr />

<h4 id="basic-configuration">Basic Configuration</h4>

<p>Before you move forward, if you are not familiar at all with file upload with Django, it is a good a idea to check
this post I published while ago: <a href="https://www.djangoproject.com/tutorial/2016/08/01/how-to-upload-files-with-django.html">How to Upload Files With Django</a>.
It will give you an overview of the basics and some caveats.</p>

<p>To work with file upload you will need to set the <code class="highlighter-rouge">MEDIA_URL</code> and <code class="highlighter-rouge">MEDIA_ROOT</code>.</p>

<p><strong>settings.py</strong></p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-python"><span class="n">MEDIA_URL</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s">'/media/'</span>
<span class="n">MEDIA_ROOT</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">os</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">path</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">join</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">BASE_DIR</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s">'media'</span><span class="p">)</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>And to test the uploads in the development environment, add this to the button of your root urlconf:</p>

<p><strong>urls.py</strong></p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-python"><span class="kn">from</span> <span class="nn">django.conf</span> <span class="kn">import</span> <span class="n">settings</span>
<span class="kn">from</span> <span class="nn">django.conf.urls</span> <span class="kn">import</span> <span class="n">url</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">include</span>
<span class="kn">from</span> <span class="nn">django.conf.urls.static</span> <span class="kn">import</span> <span class="n">static</span>

<span class="n">urlpatterns</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="p">[</span>
    <span class="c"># ...</span>
<span class="p">]</span>

<span class="k">if</span> <span class="n">settings</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">DEBUG</span><span class="p">:</span>
    <span class="n">urlpatterns</span> <span class="o">+=</span> <span class="n">static</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">settings</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">MEDIA_URL</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">document_root</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="n">settings</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">MEDIA_ROOT</span><span class="p">)</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>Now the rest are static assets, mostly JavaScript assets. Here’s what we are going to use:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap/releases/tag/v3.3.7" target="_blank">Bootstrap 3.3.7</a> Not required. Just so our example looks better.</li>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/jquery/jquery/releases/tag/3.1.1" target="_blank">jQuery 3.1.1</a> Base dependency of the plug-in.</li>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/blueimp/jQuery-File-Upload/releases/tag/v9.14.1" target="_blank">jQuery File Upload 9.14.1</a> That’s the stuff.</li>
</ul>

<p>Now you will see that the <strong>jQuery File Upload</strong> comes with several script files, they all have a purpose and you will
only need some of them for certain features.</p>

<p>Here is how my base template looks like:</p>

<p><strong>base.html</strong></p>

<span class="nt">&lt;/html&gt;</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>Bootstrap and jQuery in the base template, and the jQuery File Upload plug-in will be added using the

<p>We are using a basic Class-Based View, defining two request processing for the <strong>GET</strong> and <strong>POST</strong> methods.
Essentially when we access the page where we handle the upload, we are going to show the user a list of uploaded
photos.</p>

<p>For the POST, it is where the upload handling happens, using Django’s Model Forms. When we call <code class="highlighter-rouge">form.save()</code>, Django
will create a <code class="highlighter-rouge">Photo</code> instance and save the file in the file system.</p>

<p>We will follow the same strategy for the next examples as well.</p>

<p>Now where the magic happens, in the client side. First the required jQuery File Upload scripts:</p>

<p><strong>photos/basic_upload/index.html</strong></p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-django"><span class="cp">{%</span> <span class="k">block</span> <span class="nv">javascript</span> <span class="cp">%}</span>
  <span class="c">{# JQUERY FILE UPLOAD SCRIPTS #}</span>
  <span class="nt">&lt;script </span><span class="na">src=</span><span class="s">"</span><span class="cp">{%</span> <span class="nv">static</span> <span class="s1">'js/jquery-file-upload/vendor/jquery.ui.widget.js'</span> <span class="cp">%}</span><span class="s">"</span><span class="nt">&gt;&lt;/script&gt;</span>

  <span class="nt">&lt;script </span><span class="na">src=</span><span class="s">"</span><span class="cp">{%</span> <span class="nv">static</span> <span class="s1">'js/jquery-file-upload/jquery.fileupload.js'</span> <span class="cp">%}</span><span class="s">"</span><span class="nt">&gt;&lt;/script&gt;</span>

  <span class="c">{# PHOTOS PAGE SCRIPTS #}</span>
  <span class="nt">&lt;script </span><span class="na">src=</span><span class="s">"</span><span class="cp">{%</span> <span class="nv">static</span> <span class="s1">'photos/js/basic-upload.js'</span> <span class="cp">%}</span><span class="s">"</span><span class="nt">&gt;&lt;/script&gt;</span>
<span class="cp">{%</span> <span class="k">endblock</span> <span class="cp">%}</span></code></pre></figure>

<ul>
  <li><strong>jquery.ui.widget.js</strong> It’s a dependency for the plug-in</li>
  <li><strong>jquery.iframe-transport.js</strong> The Iframe Transport is required for browsers without support for XHR file uploads</li>
  <li><strong>jquery.fileupload.js</strong> The basic File Upload plug-in</li>
</ul>

<p>And finally the script <strong>basic-upload.js</strong> is where we will implement our photo upload.</p>

<p>Now let’s see the rest of our template and explore the meat of the page:</p>

<p><strong>photos/basic_upload/index.html</strong></p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-django"><span class="c">{# 1. BUTTON TO TRIGGER THE ACTION #}</span>
<span class="nt">&lt;button</span> <span class="na">type=</span><span class="s">"button"</span> <span class="na">class=</span><span class="s">"btn btn-primary js-upload-photos"</span><span class="nt">&gt;</span>
  <span class="nt">&lt;span</span> <span class="na">class=</span><span class="s">"glyphicon glyphicon-cloud-upload"</span><span class="nt">&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</span> Upload photos
<span class="nt">&lt;/button&gt;</span>

<span class="c">{# 2. FILE INPUT TO BE USED BY THE PLUG-IN #}</span>

       <span class="na">style=</span><span class="s">"display: none;"</span>
       <span class="na">data-url=</span><span class="s">"</span><span class="cp">{%</span> <span class="nv">url</span> <span class="s1">'photos:basic_upload'</span> <span class="cp">%}</span><span class="s">"</span>
       <span class="na">data-form-data=</span><span class="s">'{"csrfmiddlewaretoken": "</span><span class="cp">{{</span> <span class="nv">csrf_token</span> <span class="cp">}}</span><span class="s">"}'</span><span class="nt">&gt;</span>

<span class="c">{# 3. TABLE TO DISPLAY THE UPLOADED PHOTOS #}</span>
<span class="nt">&lt;table</span> <span class="na">id=</span><span class="s">"gallery"</span> <span class="na">class=</span><span class="s">"table table-bordered"</span><span class="nt">&gt;</span>
  <span class="nt">&lt;thead&gt;</span>
    <span class="nt">&lt;tr&gt;</span>
      <span class="nt">&lt;th&gt;</span>Photo<span class="nt">&lt;/th&gt;</span>
    <span class="nt">&lt;/tr&gt;</span>
  <span class="nt">&lt;/thead&gt;</span>
  <span class="nt">&lt;tbody&gt;</span>
    <span class="cp">{%</span> <span class="k">for</span> <span class="nv">photo</span> <span class="ow">in</span> <span class="nv">photos</span> <span class="cp">%}</span>
      <span class="nt">&lt;tr&gt;</span>
        <span class="nt">&lt;td&gt;&lt;a</span> <span class="na">href=</span><span class="s">"</span><span class="cp">{{</span> <span class="nv">photo.file.url</span> <span class="cp">}}</span><span class="s">"</span><span class="nt">&gt;</span><span class="cp">{{</span> <span class="nv">photo.file.name</span> <span class="cp">}}</span><span class="nt">&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;</span>
      <span class="nt">&lt;/tr&gt;</span>
    <span class="cp">{%</span> <span class="k">endfor</span> <span class="cp">%}</span>
  <span class="nt">&lt;/tbody&gt;</span>
<span class="nt">&lt;/table&gt;</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>First, <strong>block 1</strong> of the snippet, is the button to start the workflow. We will hook into the css class
<strong>.js-upload-photos</strong> to open the file explorer window.</p>

<p><strong>Block 2</strong> is the most important part of the page. It’s the the file input that will be used to load the jQuery File
Upload component. A few things to note:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The name of the input must match with the Model Form Field. That is, if the field is called <strong>document</strong>, the input
must be named <code class="highlighter-rouge">name="document"</code> instead. Otherwise the processing of the file will fail.</li>
  <li>The <code class="highlighter-rouge">multiple</code> attribute will enable multiple file selection in the file explorer window.</li>
  <li>The <code class="highlighter-rouge">data-url</code> attribute must point to the route/view where the file form will be processed.</li>
  <li>The <code class="highlighter-rouge">data-form-data</code> attribute should be defined <strong>exactly</strong> this way! Don’t try to swap the <code class="highlighter-rouge">"</code> and <code class="highlighter-rouge">'</code> of the HTML.
It won’t work. This line is important so to instruct the plug-in to send the file along with the csrf middleware token.</li>
</ul>

<p>Finally, <strong>block 3</strong> is just a regular table displaying the photos.</p>

<p>Now let’s explore the page’s script, which is responsible for putting every piece of this puzzle together:</p>

<p><strong>photos/js/basic-upload.js</strong></p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-javascript"><span class="nx">$</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="kd">function</span> <span class="p">()</span> <span class="p">{</span>
  <span class="cm">/* 1. OPEN THE FILE EXPLORER WINDOW */</span>

        <span class="nx">$</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s2">"#gallery tbody"</span><span class="p">).</span><span class="nx">prepend</span><span class="p">(</span>
          <span class="s2">"&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href='"</span> <span class="o">+</span> <span class="nx">data</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">result</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">url</span> <span class="o">+</span> <span class="s2">"'&gt;"</span> <span class="o">+</span> <span class="nx">data</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">result</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">name</span> <span class="o">+</span> <span class="s2">"&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;"</span>
        <span class="p">)</span>
      <span class="p">}</span>
    <span class="p">}</span>
  <span class="p">});</span>

<span class="p">});</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>Remember how we returned the data in the View class?</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-python"><span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">post</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="bp">self</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">request</span><span class="p">):</span>
    <span class="n">form</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">PhotoForm</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="bp">self</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">request</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">POST</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="bp">self</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">request</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">FILES</span><span class="p">)</span>
    <span class="k">if</span> <span class="n">form</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">is_valid</span><span class="p">():</span>
        <span class="n">photo</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">form</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">save</span><span class="p">()</span>
        <span class="n">data</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="p">{</span><span class="s">'is_valid'</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="bp">True</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s">'name'</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="n">photo</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="nb">file</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">name</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s">'url'</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="n">photo</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="nb">file</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">url</span><span class="p">}</span>
    <span class="k">else</span><span class="p">:</span>
        <span class="n">data</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="p">{</span><span class="s">'is_valid'</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="bp">False</span><span class="p">}</span>
    <span class="k">return</span> <span class="n">JsonResponse</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">data</span><span class="p">)</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>This <code class="highlighter-rouge">JsonResponse</code> will end up in the <strong>data</strong> parameter, passed to the anonymous function hooked to the <strong>done</strong>
event of the File Upload component.</p>

<p>See what we are doing here? When we are accessing <code class="highlighter-rouge">data.result.name</code>, we are accessing the <strong>name</strong> we returned in the
<code class="highlighter-rouge">JsonResponse</code>. So, let’s say, if we returned:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-python"><span class="k">return</span> <span class="n">JsonResponse</span><span class="p">({</span><span class="s">'message'</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="s">'Success'</span><span class="p">})</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>We would be able to catch it inside the <strong>done</strong> function, this way:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-javascript"><span class="nx">done</span><span class="err">:</span> <span class="kd">function</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">e</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="nx">data</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">{</span>
  <span class="k">if</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">data</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">result</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">message</span> <span class="o">===</span> <span class="s1">'Success'</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="c1">// do something...</span>
  <span class="p">}</span>
<span class="p">}</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>But, what we are actually doing there is putting some pieces of HTML together and prepending it to the table body.</p>

<p>Let’s look at some screen shots to see how it looks like:</p>

<p><img alt="Basic File Upload" src="https://www.djangoproject.com/media/2016/11/uploads1.png" /></p>

<p>Then when the user clicks in the <strong>Upload photos</strong> button:</p>

<p><img alt="Basic File Upload" src="https://www.djangoproject.com/media/2016/11/uploads2.png" /></p>

<p>The user selects as may files as he wants and hit the <strong>Open</strong> button:</p>

<p><img alt="Basic File Upload" src="https://www.djangoproject.com/media/2016/11/uploads3.png" /></p>

<p>And all the files are uploaded to the server and added to the table, with a valid link! This is a minimum example.
When you grab the code you will see it is really easy to reproduce.</p>

<p>It’s great already! Works on most major web browsers (IE 6.0+ for example!). And it is just a matter of what data to
return, and what to do with it.</p>

<hr />

<h4 id="displaying-the-progress">Displaying the Progress</h4>

<p>An improvement we can make, is to add a progress bar, to not let the users hanging without knowing what is going on.</p>

<p>In our template, add the following snippet. It’s a Bootstrap modal:</p>

<p><strong>photos/basic_upload/index.html</strong></p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-django"><span class="nt">&lt;div</span> <span class="na">class=</span><span class="s">"modal fade"</span> <span class="na">id=</span><span class="s">"modal-progress"</span> <span class="na">data-backdrop=</span><span class="s">"static"</span> <span class="na">data-keyboard=</span><span class="s">"false"</span><span class="nt">&gt;</span>
  <span class="nt">&lt;div</span> <span class="na">class=</span><span class="s">"modal-dialog"</span><span class="nt">&gt;</span>

      <span class="nt">&lt;div</span> <span class="na">class=</span><span class="s">"modal-header"</span><span class="nt">&gt;</span>
        <span class="nt">&lt;h4</span> <span class="na">class=</span><span class="s">"modal-title"</span><span class="nt">&gt;</span>Uploading...<span class="nt">&lt;/h4&gt;</span>
      <span class="nt">&lt;/div&gt;</span>
      <span class="nt">&lt;div</span> <span class="na">class=</span><span class="s">"modal-body"</span><span class="nt">&gt;</span>
        <span class="nt">&lt;div</span> <span class="na">class=</span><span class="s">"progress"</span><span class="nt">&gt;</span>
          <span class="nt">&lt;div</span> <span class="na">class=</span><span class="s">"progress-bar"</span> <span class="na">role=</span><span class="s">"progressbar"</span> <span class="na">style=</span><span class="s">"width: 0%;"</span><span class="nt">&gt;</span>0%<span class="nt">&lt;/div&gt;</span>
        <span class="nt">&lt;/div&gt;</span>
      <span class="nt">&lt;/div&gt;</span>
    <span class="nt">&lt;/div&gt;</span>
  <span class="nt">&lt;/div&gt;</span>
<span class="nt">&lt;/div&gt;</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>Let’s improve the JavaScript part so to calculate the progress:</p>

<p><strong>photos/js/basic-upload.js</strong></p>

<p>The <strong>sequentialUploads</strong> attribute will instruct the component to send one file at a time. What we are doing here
basically is showing the loading modal when the upload starts, closing it when it finalizes, meanwhile we update the
percentage in the progress bar. The rest is the same from the other example.</p>

<p>Here is how it will look like:</p>

<p><img alt="Progress Bar" src="https://www.djangoproject.com/media/2016/11/uploads4.png" /></p>

<hr />

<h4 id="drag-and-drop-upload">Drag and Drop Upload</h4>

<p>Something great about this plug-in, by default you can drop files anywhere in the page to start the upload process!
This mean the previous examples will simply work.</p>

<p>What we can do to help the users discover the functionality is just adding this simple HTML, for example:</p>

<p><strong>photos/basic_upload/index.html</strong></p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-django"><span class="nt">&lt;div</span> <span class="na">class=</span><span class="s">"well text-muted text-center"</span> <span class="na">style=</span><span class="s">"padding-top: 4rem; padding-bottom: 4rem;"</span><span class="nt">&gt;</span>
  <span class="nt">&lt;span</span> <span class="na">class=</span><span class="s">"glyphicon glyphicon-arrow-down"</span> <span class="na">style=</span><span class="s">"font-size: 4rem;"</span><span class="nt">&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</span>
  <span class="nt">&lt;h3&gt;</span>Drop Photos Here to Upload<span class="nt">&lt;/h3&gt;</span>
<span class="nt">&lt;/div&gt;</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>And the result will be something like this:</p>

<p><img alt="Drag and Drop Upload" src="https://www.djangoproject.com/media/2016/11/uploads5.png" /></p>

<h4 id="conclusions">Conclusions</h4>

<p>I wanted to give more tips and examples about the jQuery File Upload usage. But the post was already getting big. I
will continue this post next week. So, let me know what you want to see next!</p>

<p>Anyway, the examples shown in this tutorial should cover the Django part. The rest is a matter of configuration and
playing with the plug-in. For more details about its API and features, refer to the official documentation:
<a href="https://github.com/blueimp/jQuery-File-Upload/wiki" target="_blank">jQuery File Upload Docs</a></p>

<p>The code used in this tutorial is available on GitHub: <a href="https://github.com/sibtc/multiple-file-upload" target="_blank">github.com/sibtc/multiple-file-upload</a>,
so you can try it locally. It’s very straightforward to get it running.</p>
